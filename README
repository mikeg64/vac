Installation of VAC 4.5

All file names are relative to the main "vac" directory.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Making Perl work

   If the Perl interpreter is not in the default path (try typing 'perl -v')
   set the path in the .login to something like
   
setenv PATH .:/usr/local/bin/perl:$PATH

   The first lines of the Perl scripts have to contain the full path to 
   the "perl" program. On most machines it is /usr/bin/perl. If it is
   different on your machine, you should run

perl -i Fix/PERL

2. Update the Makefile

   The src/Makefile needs to be modified to work with your compilers. 

   There are a few useful but non-standard Fortran 90 lines in the source code.
   If your compiler complains about some of them do the following:

   - Forall is unknown: change the Makefile so that it uses "forall2do".

   - The subroutine flushunit at the end of src/vacio.t does not compile:
     modify subroutine flushunit according to the comments.
     If your compiler does not support any form of flush, 
     modify subroutine flushunit to do nothing.

   - The function "cputime" at the end of src/vac.t does not compile: 
     This problem cannot occur for F90 which has a standard timing function.
     For GNU's g77 compiler replace F77_ by G77_ in the cputime function.
     For other Fortran 77 compilers use the timing function specific to that
     machine, or just set cputime=-1.D0 and forget about timing.
     On the Cray C90, comment out the normal Fortran 90 lines and 
     uncomment the "cputime=second()" line.

3. Read the manual files !

   There is a new manual file for MPI parallel runs (relative to VAC 4.02).
   If you want to run VAC on a parallel machine or a cluster, read 
   Man/mpi.html.

   The IDL macros have been greatly improved and modified. If you plan to use 
   IDL for visualization, read Man/idl.html.

   If you are a new user start reading with the Features.html and 
   USAGE.html manual files, and try to do the examples with weblink.pl

   If you have an earlier version of VAC check the Man/Diary.html manual
   to see what is new. 

   The manual files can be read via the VAC User Interface, started by typing

weblink.pl &

   or directly with a web browser like "netscape" or "mozilla":

netscape Man/Contents.html

   You can print out the manual pages from the browser file by file,
   or print Man/MANUAL.ps.gz directly which was produced according
   to the procedure described in Man/Makefile. This Man/Makefile includes a
   "make print" option, so get a print out by

cd Man
make print

   If you have no web browser, you may read the manuals in an ASCII format by

cd Man
ASCII Contents.html | more
ASCII idl.html      | lpr

Good luck,
