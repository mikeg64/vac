<H3><A NAME="Project">Project</A></h3>

This software was developed by G&aacute;bor T&oacute;th at the Astronomical 
Institute at Utrecht from November 8 1994 to August 15 1997. 
The project is done in a collaboration with the FOM Institute for Plasma 
Physics, the Mathematics department at Utrecht and the CWI at Amsterdam. 
In particular, Rony Keppens (FOM), Mikhail Botchev (Mathematics Dept.), and
Auke van der Ploeg (CWI) contributed significantly to the development since
1996. 
<A HREF="http://hermes.elte.hu/~gtoth">G. T&oacute;th</A> and 
<A HREF="http://www.rijnh.nl/n3/n2/">R. Keppens</A>
share the responsibility and work associated with the development, 
maintenance, distribution, and management of the software. 
The work has been funded by the Dutch Science Fundation (NWO) 
in a program of <A HREF="http://phys.uu.nl/~mpr">
Massive Parallel Processing Applied to Magnetohydrodynamics</A>,
and by the Dutch National Computing Facilities Foundation (NCF) for the use
of supercomputer facilities.

VAC aims to advance a system of hyperbolic equations by a number of
different numerical schemes. The equations are stored in separate 
modules, and they can be selected by a simple configuration of the
VACPP preprocessor. The dimensionality of the problem is also set 
through VACPP. The numerical schemes are able to handle discontinuities
and smooth flows as well.
<p>
VACINI is provided as an additional tool to produce or modify initial 
conditions for VAC, however, the initial data can be produced by other
means too. Visualization or analysis of the results can be done by
the powerful IDL, MATLAB, and SuperMongo macros provided in the package.
Conversion to data formats used by AVS, DX, and Gnuplot is also supported.
<p>
The VACPP preprocessor translates the dimensional independent notation 
(based on the Loop Annotation Syntax, 
<A HREF="http://hermes.elte.hu/~gtoth/Papers/vac.html#LASY">LASY</A>)
to Fortran 90. <b>Parallel machines</b> with a High Performance Fortran (HPF)
compiler or the Message Passing Interface (MPI) library
can run VAC in parallel. For HPF parallelization the code is translated 
by the F90TOHPF Perl script. If no Fortran 90 or
HPF compiler are available, the F90TOF77 Perl script can be used for
translating to Fortran 77. The Perl interpreter is installed at most places,
and it is freely available from the net.
<p>
The configuration and compilation procedures as well as the simulations
can be done via the web based VAC User Interface. This requires the Weblink
web server (provided with the software for this purpose only, a product
of and copyrighted by the US based WWLINK company) and a web browser like 
Netscape or Mozilla.

<H3><A NAME="Philosophy">Philosophy</A></h3>

The philosophy behind VAC is using a single versatile software 
with options and switches for various problems, rather than developing
a different method or version for each problem separately. The advantage
of such a general approach is a reduction of overall time for software 
development, easier maintenance, compatibility of different parts, 
automatic extension of new features to all existing applications. 
The price of the general approach is some added complexity in the source.
<p>
VAC is not a fool-proof black-box design. The user is expected to 
understand how the different parameters change the behaviour of the
code, and to be able to complete user written subroutines for source
terms, special boundary conditions etc. if needed. It is essential to
keep the user written parts well separated, since newer versions of VAC
are under development. Please put added subroutines into a separate 
VACUSR module, e.g. into the <b>vacusr.t.MINE</b> file and signal 
any additions in the other source files by some comment line, e.g. 
!BEGIN USER ADDED and !END USER ADDED. If you change something, keep the 
original version commented out as !ORIGINAL. If you think your subroutine 
is of general interest please send the source with some explanations to me.

<H3><A NAME="Distribution">Distribution</A></h3>

Although VAC is distributed for no charge, there is a considerable amount
of work behind its development. For this reason, at least one of the
developers of the code expect to be co-author in the first publication 
which uses VAC in a substantial way, and to be
referenced and acknowledged in later publications as the author of the 
original software. On the other hand, we provide assistance for the user in 
the initial set up, and later if problems arise. The user will be notified 
about any major improvement or addition to the code. If you are interested
in applying the software to scientific problems being studied at the 
Astronomical Institute at Utrecht or at the FOM Institute at Nieuwegein, 
then we expect that providing the software will lead to collaboration.
