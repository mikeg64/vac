<h1>USING AXIAL SYMMETRY</h1>

This document describes how to use properly axial symmetry and polar grids
for VAC. Please read it carefully before you start to do simulations with 
<b>typeaxial</b> different from 'slab' in the <b>methodlist</b> of 
your <b>par/PROBLEM</b> parameter file.

<H2><A NAME="What">What</A> does Axial Symmetry Mean?</H2>

In 1 and 2D simulations, there is an inherent assumption about the behavior
of quantities in the ignored direction(s). The most usual assumption is
'slab' symmetry, i.e. all the quantities are invariant to a translation in the 
ignored direction. This is the default value for <b>typeaxial</b> in the method
list in the <b>par/DEFAULT</b> file. 
<p>
In 2D, one may assume a rotational invariance around some axis instead, which
gives a cylindrical symmetry, thus <b>typeaxial='cylinder'</b> should be 
selected. VAC always assumes that the radial distance from the symmetry axis 
is in the first coordinate, which can therefore be referred to as <b>r_</b>, 
where <b>r_=1</b> is an integer parameter set in <b>src/vacdef.t</b>. 
The second coordinate is interpreted as the one parallel to the axis, 
<b>z_=2</b>, while the ignored direction, if used, is <b>phi_=3</b> in 2.5D.
The PHI components of vector variables are therefore
stored in the third component in 2.5D simulations:
<pre>
setvac -d=23 -z=2 -phi=3
</pre>
Although this order of the variables implies a left handed coordinate 
system, the equations are solved correctly. 
For visualization the order of coordinates can be changed arbitrarily.
<p>
In 2.0D simulations in the R-Z plane, however, you should set
<pre>
setvac -d=22 -z=2 -phi=0
</pre>
which makes the index values for the PHI components of vector variables 
negative, i.e. they are not to be used! 
<p>
In 1D there are lots of possibilities. Slab symmetry is trivial, but there
are two possibilities for cylindrical symmetry in 1.5D:
<pre>
setvac -d=12 -z=2 -phi=0
setvac -d=12 -phi=2 -z=0
</pre>
When all three vector components are used,
<pre>
setvac -d=13 -z=2 -phi=3
</pre>
should be used just like in 2.5D.
<p>
In spherical symmetry, <b>typeaxial='sphere'</b>, the invariant transformation 
is a rotation around the origin. Again, the first coordinate is <b>r_=1</b> 
while the other two are the transverse components, they are physically not 
distinguishable. 
<p>
In 1.0D (setvac -d=11 -phi=0 -z=0)
nozzle symmetry can be used with <b>typeaxial='nozzle'</b>.
It is a kind of local conical symmetry, 
where the opening angle of the nozzle determines the distance to the center of 
the symmetry. The flow is assumed to be parallel to the walls of the nozzle on 
the surface, and purely radial in the center line. 
Since the nozzle symmetry is implemented for <b>src/vacphys.t.hd</b> and 
<b>src/vacphys.t.hdadiab</b> only, a radial acceleration due to thermal 
pressure on the walls is the only effect from the nozzle symmetry.
The shape of the nozzle should be defined in <b>src/vacgrid.setnozzle.t</b>.
<p>
In the source code, the ^IFPHI and ^IFZ conditional patterns can be used
to avoid the compiler warnings about indices out of range. The patterns
remove the attached text when phi_ or z_ are negative, respectively.
Another way to avoid compiler warnings is the use of pphi_=min(1,phi_) 
and zz_=min(1,z_) for the indices, but you have to make sure that the 
statements are not executed when phi_ and z_ are negative, respectively.

<H2><A NAME="Polargrid">What</A> does Polar Grid Mean?</H2>

In case of a polar grid the PHI direction is not ignored, thus you can use
<pre>
setvac -d=22 -phi=2 -z=0
setvac -d=23 -phi=2 -z=3
setvac -d=33 -phi=2 -z=3
setvac -d=33 -phi=3 -z=2
</pre>
A polar grid functionally is very similar to the special case of 
generalized coordinates where the gridpoints are located on circles, 
but it is realized in a very different way. VAC recognizes a polar grid
when the coordinate index <b>phi_ &lt;= NDIM</b> and the parameter 
<b>typeaxial='cylinder'</b> is set. When these two conditions are met, 
the global logical variable <b>polargrid</b> is set to true.
<p>
In 2D, the data in the <b>x</b> coordinates is interpreted as radial distance
<b>r</b> and the angular coordinate <b>phi</b> is measured in radians.
The <b>dx</b> array contains <b>dr</b> and <b>r*dphi</b> and VAC treats
everything the same way as in a Cartesian grid (gencoord=F and ndim=2 in the 
data file). The main difference is that the geometric source terms are added
due to <b>typeaxial='cylinder'</b>. Some source terms, e.g. viscosity,
also differ slightly.
<p>
In 3D, there are two possibilities: the coordinates can be ordered as 
<b>r, z, phi</b> or <b>r, phi, z</b>, where <b>z</b> is the vertical position.
The grid can be Cartesian in the <b>r, z</b> coordinates, in which case the 
full grid is handled as a Cartesian-like grid (gencoord=F and ndim=3 in the 
data files). 
Otherwise the grid can be generalized in the <b>r,z</b> coordinates 
(gencoord=T, ndim=-3), i.e. the grid points for a fixed 
<b>phi</b> can be positioned arbitrarily in the poloidal plane, however, 
there can be no variation with the phi index, so the grid in all poloidal 
planes must look the same. Such a grid is a <i>generalized polar grid</i>.
In 3D, the <b>dx</b> array contains <b>dz</b> in addition to <b>dr</b> and 
<b>r*dphi</b>. In the generalized polar grid case the normal vectors, surfaces,
and volumes of the grid cells are also set similarly as for a 2D generalized
grid with axial symmetry except for some additional <b>Delta phi</b> factors.
<p>
The vector variables also have their components in the <b>r, phi</b>, and 
<b>z</b> directions. These facts should be kept in mind when the initial 
conditions are defined, when source terms are applied, or when the results are 
visualized.
<p>
The discretizations in polar and generalized coordinates are quite different,
so results may slightly differ. The difference should vanish proportional
to <b>dx^2</b> as <b>dx --> 0</b>. Typically, a simulation on a polar grid 
will be more efficient, since the discretization is substantially simpler
(except for the generalized polar grid). 
Another advantage of using a polar grid is the possibility to use the 
<A HREF=par.html#Methodlist>angmomfix</A> parameter to conserve angular 
momentum instead of the <b>m_phi</b> momentum. On 3D generalized polar
grid, angmomfix can only be used with the <b>r, z, phi</b> coordinate ordering.
<p>
Finally, results obtained in 1.5D axial symmetry agree exactly with 
results obtained on a 2D polar grid with zero gradients in the <b>phi</b>
direction, while this holds only approximately for 2D calculations on
a circular grid with generalized coordinates.
Similarly, 2.5D axial symmetry agrees exactly with 3D polar grid if there is
no variation with <b>phi</b>. This can be very useful when a 1.5D or 2.5D
stationary solution is used as an initial condition for 2D or 3D simulations,
respectively.

<H2><A NAME="Implementation">Implementation</A></H2>

In slab symmetry all fluxes entering the cells from the ignored direction 
cancel exactly. In cylindrical or spherical symmetry, however, there are
non-vanishing contributions. These extra fluxes are always functions of 
the quantities in the local cell and of the geometry only, since due to 
the symmetry assumption, the quantities in the virtual neighbouring cells 
in the ignored direction(s) are the same as in the local cell except for the 
geometrical transformation, e.g. rotation of vector quantities around 
the symmetry axis. Consequently the contributions are added like source 
terms in the <b>addgeometry</b> subroutine in <b>src/vacphys</b>. 
To maintain hydrostatic equilibrium exactly, the 'geometrical sources' 
are added at the same time as fluxes in the radial direction.
An exception from this is TVD, which uses special <em>preprocessing and
postprocessing</em> steps (invented by D. Ryu) to include geometrical 
terms and ordinary source terms to second order accuracy.
<p>
On a polar grid the extra terms are exactly the same as for cylindrical 
symmetry.
<p>
When <b>angmomfix</b> is switched on, the geometrical source terms for 
<b>m_phi</b> cancel, because of the different discretization used.

<H2><A NAME="Boundary">Boundary</A> at the Symmetry Axis</H2>

There should be no (ghost) cell center lying on the symmetry axis, ie. the 
radial coordinates should jump through <b>r=0</b>. Using the <b>domain</b> action in
VACINI makes it easy to avoid this problem, for example in 2D
<pre>
domain
10  10
 0.  0.
10.  3.
</pre>
will generate <b>r=0.5,1.5,...,9.5</b> and <b>z=0.15,0.45,...,2.85</b> and 
the ghost cells will be on the other side of the axis at <b>r=-0.5,-1.5</b>.
The cell surface area is proportional to the radial distance, thus it is 
zero between the first ghost cell and the mesh cell right at the axis. 
Consequently the fluxes through the cell surface vanish, and as far as 
fluxes are concerned, the boundary condition at <b>r=0</b> does not
depend on the boundary type. Perfectionists should use <b>'asymm'</b> 
type boundary for the radial and PHI vector components and <b>'symm'</b> 
for all other variables. This is the correct physical description and 
it may have a slight influence on the limiters applied on the physical cells.
