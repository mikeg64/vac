<H2><A NAME="RHO">Transport</A> Equation: vacphys.t.rho</h2>

<IMG SRC="eq.rho.gif" WIDTH=143 HEIGHT=31>
<p>
The transport equation describes the transport of a scalar field, 
here the density <b>rho</b> by a prescribed velocity field. 
This equation is used for test purposes.
<p>
The <b>eqpar(v1_), eqpar(v2_), ...</b>
equation parameters define the components of the uniform velocity field.
As a special case, in 2D a solid rotation <b>v1=-x2, v2=x1</b> is taken
if <b>eqpar(v1_)=12345</b> is set.
<p>
For a linear scalar equation the Riemann solver is trivial, thus the TVD type 
methods give identical results.


<H2><A NAME="HDADIAB">Adiabatic</A> Hydrodynamics: vacphys.t.hdadiab<br>
Includes the Shallow Water equations</h2>

<IMG SRC="eq.hdadiab.gif" WIDTH=230 HEIGHT=90>
<p>
The system of adiabatic hydrodynamical equations are solved for the density
<b>rho</b> and the momentum density <b>m=rho*v</b>. 
The pressure is a function of
density only since an isentropic initial condition is assumed. There are two
equation parameters, the adiabatic index <b>eqpar(gamma_)</b> and the adiabatic
constant <b>eqpar(adiab_)</b>. Note that the adiabatic hydrodynamical equations
cannot handle discontinuities physically correctly, since in reality the
adiabatic constant becomes different in different regions. For modeling
a flow with discontinuities the full set of Euler equations have to be solved.
<p>
The system of <b>shallow water equations</b> is a special case with the following
identifications: <b>rho=h</b> represents the height of the water column, 
<b>eqpar(gamma_)=2</b> and the adiabatic coefficient is half of the gravitational 
acceleration <b>eqpar(adiab_)=g/2</b>.
<p>
There is a Roe-type Riemann solver implemented using arithmetic averaging.

<H2><A NAME="HD">Hydrodynamics</A>: vacphys.t.hd</h2>

<IMG SRC="eq.hd.gif" WIDTH=233 HEIGHT=115>
<p>
The Euler equations are solved for density <b>rho</b>, the momentum density 
<b>m=rho*v</b> and the total energy density <b>e</b>. The pressure is a 
derived quantity which is calculated from the conservative variables. 
This may lead to an unphysical negative pressure, which is replaced by the 
<b>smallp</b> and <b>smallpcoeff</b> parameters in the <A HREF="par.html#Methodlist">par/PROBLEM file</A>.
<p>
There is a single equation parameter, the adiabatic index <b>eqpar(gamma_)</b>.
The Riemann solver uses the Roe-average.

<H2><A NAME="MHDISO">Isothermal</A> and Polytropic Magnetohydrodynamics: <br>
vacphys.t.mhdiso</h2>

<IMG SRC="eq.mhdiso.gif" WIDTH=458 HEIGHT=182>
<p>
The <em>isothermal</em> MHD equations are an approximation to a highly 
radiative or conducting plasma which does not change its temperature. 
This corresponds to <b>eqpar(gamma_)=1</b> and the thermal pressure depends 
on the square of the sound speed <b>eqpar(csound2_)</b>. Alternatively,
for some analytic MHD models a <em>polytropic</em> equation of state 
can be assumed and <b>eqpar(gamma_)&gt;1</b>. In this case the 
the second equation parameter is interpreted as the 
adiabatic coefficient <b>eqpar(adiab_)</b>
(adiab_ is an alternative index name instead of csound2_).
In both cases, the energy equation is not needed and the conservative 
variables are density  <b>rho</b>, momentum density <b>m=rho*v</b>, and the 
magnetic field <b>B</b>. 
The magnetic field is measured in units for which the magnetic 
permeability is 1.
The total, magnetic and thermal pressures are derived from the 
conservative variables either based on the isothermal or the polytropic
assumption.
<p>
The source terms proportional to <b>div B</b> are 
<A HREF="methods.html#Powell's">Powell's fix</A> for the numerical
problems related to the divergence of the magnetic field. They are used only
in more than 1D when <b>divbfix=T</b> is set in the <A HREF="par.html#Methodlist">parameter file</A>. 
Alternatively the <A HREF="methods.html#Projection">projection scheme</A> 
or the Constrained Transport / Central Difference (CT/CD)
<A HREF="methods.html#Constrain">schemes</A> can be used.
<p>
The remaining source term with <b>eta</b> in it is the resistive term,
controlled by the third equation parameter <b>eqpar(eta_)</b>. 
Ideal MHD corresponds to <b>eqpar(eta_)=0</b>, positive values give a uniform 
resistivity, while a negative value calls <b>subroutine specialeta</b> in
the <A HREF=vacusr.html#Specialsource>VACUSR module</A> to determine the 
resistivity as a function of the coordinates, of the conservative variables,
and/or of the current density. This subroutine is to be completed by the user.
For <i>ideal</i> isothermal/polytropic MHD problems the resistivity
module is not needed. Using 'setvac -off=resist' will save some memory
and compilation time.
<p>
There is a Roe-type Riemann solver implemented using arithmetic averaging.

<H2><A NAME="MHD">Magnetohydrodynamics</A>: vacphys.t.mhd</h2>

<IMG SRC="eq.mhd.gif" WIDTH=514 HEIGHT=171>
<p>
This is the full system of the MHD equations, with the following conservative 
variables: density <b>rho</b>, momentum density <b>m=rho*v</b>, total energy 
density <b>e</b> and the magnetic field <b>B</b>. 
The magnetic field is measured in units for which the magnetic 
permeability is 1. The thermal pressure can become negative
numerically, then it is replaced by the <b>smallp</b> parameter defined in the
<A HREF="par.html#Methodlist">par/PROBLEM file</A>.
<p>
There are two types of source terms on the right hand side. The ones with
<b>eta</b> in them are the resistive terms, evaluated as source terms, the
other terms proportional to <b>div B</b> are 
<A HREF="methods.html#Powell's">Powell's fix</A> for the numerical
problems related to the divergence of the magnetic field. They are used only
in more than 1D when <b>divbfix=T</b> is set in the <A HREF="par.html#Methodlist">parameter file</A>. 
Alternatively the <A HREF="methods.html#Projection">projection scheme</A> 
or the Constrained Transport / Central Difference (CT/CD)
<A HREF="methods.html#Constrain">schemes</A> can be used.
<p>
There are two equation parameters: the adiabatic index <b>eqpar(gamma_)</b>, 
and the resistivity <b>eqpar(eta_)</b>. Ideal MHD corresponds to 
<b>eqpar(eta_)=0</b>,
positive values give a uniform resistivity, while a negative value calls the 
<b>specialeta</b> procedure in the <A HREF=vacusr.html#Specialsource>
VACUSR module</A> to determine the resistivity as a function of the 
coordinates, of the conservative variables, and/or of the current density.
This subroutine is to be completed by the user.
For <i>ideal</i> MHD problems the resistivity module is not needed. 
Using 'setvac -off=resist' will save some memory and compilation time.
<p>
The source file contains comments on how a non-ideal equation of state
can be implemented. These subroutines are called if <b>eqpar(gamma_)</b>
is negative.
<p>
There is a Roe-type Riemann solver implemented using arithmetic averaging.

<H2><A NAME="New">Creating</A> a New VACPHYS Module</H2>

A new physics module should be created when the equations to be solved differ
significantly from the equations already implemented. If the difference can be
described by source terms (e.g. heat conduction, viscosity, radiative cooling,
external gravitational field etc.), the 
<A HREF="vacusr.html#Specialsource">specialsource</A> subroutine of
the VACUSR module should be used instead of writing a new VACPHYS module.
<p>
A new VACPHYS module may be created gradually. The first step is to create 
three new files <b>src/vacphys0.t.NEWEQ, src/vacphys.t.NEWEQ</b>, and
<b>src/vacpar.t.NEWEQ</b>.
You may start from scratch, i.e. from the <b>src/vacphys0.t.nul, 
src/vacphys.t.nul</b>, and <b>src/vacpar.t.nul</b> files, 
or you may copy and edit a VACPHYS module similar to the new one. 
<p>
The minimum requirement is to write the following two subroutines:
<b>getv</b> calculating a velocity from the conservative variables, and
<b>getflux</b> defining the fluxes. This will allow you to use the MacCormack
and FCT schemes with fixed time step on a Cartesian grid with slab symmetry. 
<p>
Next you could easily specify the <b>physini</b> subroutine that tells VAC
which variables are transformed as vectors (this is needed for generalized
coordinates), and the maximum propagation speed in <b>getcmax</b>, which is 
used by the TVDLF scheme and the <b>getdtcourant</b> subroutine allowing a 
dynamical time step. The <b>conserve</b> and <b>primitive</b> subroutines
can be used by VACINI, and the TVDLF and TVD-MUSCL schemes.
If your equations contain more restrictions on the time step 
than the CFL condition, the <b>getdt</b> subroutine could be written. 
For axial symmetry <b>addgeometry</b> should provide the <em>geometrical</em> 
source terms, while other source terms may be given in <b>addsource</b>.
<p>
At this point you can use all the non-characteristic based methods, like
the TVDLF, FCT and MacCormack schemes, without any constraint. To make the
other TVD type schemes work the subroutines in the <b>vacnul.roe.t</b> file
should be specified, and this is not a trivial task. It is probably best to
study the existing Riemann solvers to get an idea what is required.
<p>
If you think that your new VACPHYS module is of general interest, please send 
it to me with some description so that it can be included in the future
versions of the Versatile Advection Code.
