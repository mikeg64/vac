<h1>BASIC USAGE OF VAC AND VACINI</h1>
<p>
This document describes the basic use of the Versatile Advection Code. 
You are encouraged to do these steps through the <A HREF=Weblink.html>
Weblink User Interface</A> if you have Perl and a WWW browser.
<p>
Precompilation and compilation is done in the <b>src/</b> subdirectory.
The executable files get automatically to the main directory and they
use the <b>inipar/, par/</b>, and <b>data/</b> subdirectories for 
the parameter and data files. If you configure, compile, run, and visualize 
on different machines, you will have to transport the executable and/or data 
files accordingly.

<H2><A NAME="Workstation">Running</A> VAC on a Workstation or PC</h2>

<H4><A NAME="Configuration1">Configuration</A></h4>

   Go to the <b>src/</b> subdirectory with <b>cd src</b>.
<p>
   Use the Perl script <b>setvac</b> to set parameters for the VACPP 
   preprocessor (e.g. the number of vector components NDIR and the number of 
   grid dimensions NDIM); and for VAC and VACINI (e.g. the maximum grid sizes 
   or the physics file). Remember that the grid size should include the 
   ghost cells as well. For example
<pre>
setvac -g=104,104 -d=22 -p=hdadiab -u=example -on=cd,tvd,tvdlf
</pre>
   Type <b>setvac</b> with no parameters for information on all the flags.
   Type <b>setvac -s</b> to see the current configuration.
   The compiled VAC and VACINI codes print out their configurations when
   they start running.

<H4><A NAME="VACINI1">Compiling</A> and running VACINI</h4>

   Before compiling the code, check the <b>src/Makefile</b>. For the
   first time read the whole file, and select the appropriate settings.
   Later, you will mostly change the compiler flags only. Type 
<pre>
make vacini
</pre>
   to produce the code that generates the initial 
   conditions. If you do not have a Fortran 90 compiler, remember to set 
   the default compiler to Fortran 77 in the Makefile, so that the 
   <b>src/f90tof77</b> Perl script is used for translation. 
   (Alternatively, you may type <b>make vacini77</b>,
   still the resulting executable will be called <b>vacini</b>).
   You may return now to the main directory with 
<pre>
cd ..
</pre>
   <b>vacini</b> may be used interactively, but piping in a parameter 
   file is preferred:
<pre>
vacini &lt; inipar/PROBLEM
</pre>
   Here PROBLEM should be a descriptive filename, like <b>brio12</b>, with
   indication of NDIM and NDIR. Capital letters may refer to higher resolution.
   The initial file will be
<pre>
data/PROBLEM.ini
</pre>
   which is the name defined in the <b>inipar/PROBLEM</b> parameter file.
   Read Man/<A HREF="inipar.html">inipar</A> and look into <b>vacini.t</b> 
   to see how the initial parameter files can be set up. You may use your 
   own initialization program as long as the file is created in the same 
   format. Alternatively you may provide a new input subroutine 
   <A HREF=vacusr.html#Specialio>readfileini_special</A> in the 
   <b>vacusr.t.PROBLEM</b> file and set <A HREF=par.html#Filelist>
   typefileini='special'</A> in the parameter file.

<H4><A NAME="VAC1">Compiling</A> and running VAC</h4>

   <b>make vac</b> for an executable code on your machine. Like for 
   <b>vacini</b>, you can <b>make vac77</b> as well. 
   In addition you can <b>make vacsmall</b> using the 
   Perl script <b>savemem</b> which saves memory by overlapping the local 
   arrays of subroutines at the same level. The script needs the whole code 
   for processing, thus compilation takes longer. Functionally <b>vacsmall</b> 
   is identical with <b>vac</b>, but it uses less memory. 
   Type <b>savemem -help</b> for more information.
<p>
   Run the code with a parameter file
<pre>
vac &lt; par/PROBLEM
</pre>
   The results will be in the files
<pre>
data/PROBLEM.log
data/PROBLEM.out
</pre>
   as defined in the <b>par/PROBLEM</b> parameter file. 
   Read Man/<A HREF="par.html">par</A> about the parameter files. 
<p>
   For a longer run you may want to submit the job in a queue.
   At the Astronomical Institute in Utrecht, the NQS system is set up 
   such that the following simple <b>Jobs/jobdec</b> script  
<pre>
#QSUB -q long
#QSUB
vac_example &lt; par/exampleA22
</pre>
   can be submitted on the machine <b>ruunf3</b> with the commands
<pre>
rlogin ruunf3
cd vac
qsub jobdec
</pre>
   The NQS system replies with giving the <b>JOBID</b> for the submitted job.
   You can check the status of the job by the <b>qstat JOBID</b> command, 
   and delete the job by <b>qdel JOBID</b>. 
<p>
   A normal background job can be started by e.g.
<pre>
nice vac_example &lt; par/exampleA22 &gt;&amp; log.example &amp;
</pre>
   Both STDOUT and STDERR are piped into the log.example file, this works 
   under <b>tcsh</b>. The syntax may be different for other shells.
   The process ID of a running job can be found by a command like
<pre>
ps aux | grep vac
</pre>
   The process then can be killed by the <b>kill -9 PSID</b> command, 
   suspended with <b>kill -17 PSID</b> and restarted with <b>kill -19 PSID</b>.

<H2><A NAME="Cray">Running</A> VAC on the CRAY C90</H2>

   Some of the information below may be specific to the Cray C90 in Amsterdam.

<H4><A NAME="C90Makefile">Makefile</A></H4>

   Delete or comment out the DEC/SGI/SP/SUN compiler definitions and 
   uncomment the Cray C90 ones.
   FORALL is not understood by the Cray F90 compiler, therefore select
   compilation with piping the code through the <b>forall2do</b> script.
<p>
   If you selected the local BLAS and LAPACK libraries in the Makefile, 
   which is a good idea, it is necessary to use the Cray single precision 
   (real*8) subroutine names, instead of the work station double precision 
   (also real*8) names. Run the <b>Fix/cray.d2s</b> script with
<pre>
Fix/cray.d2s src/vaciter.t src/tridiag.f src/gmresr.f src/conjgrad.f
</pre>
   in the main vac/ directory to replace the D characters to S.
<p>
   Use <b>setvac</b> before compilation as usual, e.g.:
<pre>
cd src
setvac -d=22 -g=104,104 -p=hdadiab -u=example -on=cd,tvd,tvdlf -off=gencoord
make vacini
make vac
</pre>

<H4><A NAME="C90Namelist">Namelists</A></H4>

   Although namelists should be standard for Fortran 90, some older Cray F90 
   compilers want .true. and .false. for logical variables instead of T and F.
   To fix this, run the <b>Fix/T2true</b> script for all the par/ files
<pre>
Fix/T2true par/*
</pre>
   There is a restriction for repeated values given for multi-D arrays.
   Eg. for a string array arr(3,4) the namelist declaration
<pre>
arr=12*'nul'
</pre>
   is not accepted. Use instead
<pre>
arr=3*'nul',3*'nul',3*'nul',3*'nul'
</pre>
   Also take care of not leaving anything between the namelists.
   On most machines such lines are ignored, but on the Cray a 
   run time error occurs.

<H4><A NAME="C90Transfer">Transferring files</A></H4>

   The ASCII file format is machine independent, but not accurate, and not
   efficient. You can make the binary format on the Cray to be compatible
   with the binary format of most workstations. 
   On the Cray, execute <em>before running the code</em> the assignments
<pre>
assign -F f77 -N ieee_64 g:su
</pre>
   which tells the code to use UNIX Fortran 77 file format with double 
   precision IEEE standard for any sequential unformatted files.
   <em>The old version of assign on the Cray needed</em>
<pre>
assign -F f77 -N ieee_dp g:su
</pre>
   and an even older version
<pre>
assign -F f77 -N ieee u:10
assign -F f77 -N ieee u:12
</pre>
   which formats the units 10 and 12 (used by VAC for reading the input and 
   writing the output data files) as Unix F77 file formats with IEEE standard 
   for numbers. If you want to visualize the Cray files
   on a workstation all the time, you may want to put these <b>assign</b> 
   statements into your .cshrc or .login file, so it is executed automatically.
<p>
   The same assignment statements are needed in the <b>jobc90</b> script
   for submitting an NQS jobs. An example script could be
<pre>
#! /bin/sh
#QSUB -lM 12.0mw
#QSUB -lT 200
#QSUB
cd $HOME/vac/
assign -F f77 -N ieee_64 g:su
vac_example &lt; par/exampleA22
</pre>
   The <b>-lM</b> parameter defines an upper limit for the requested memory,
   while <b>-lT</b> gives the maximum run time in seconds.
   Checking the job status and deleting jobs is the same as on the 
   workstation.
<p>
   For workstations that have the same endiannes as the Cray, the only
   conversion needed is the 64byte integers transformed to 32byte integers,
   so run Fix/endian <b>on the workstation</b> as
<pre>
Fix/endian -k -c ftp-ed_cray_file new_file
</pre>
   or simply do it in-place with the -i flag
<pre>
Fix/endian -k -i ftp-ed_cray_file
</pre>
   The <b>-k</b> flag means that the endianness is kept the same.
<p>
   For the DEC Alpha and PC there is the additional little-endian vs. 
   big-endian difference, therefore you need to run 
   <em>on the DEC workstation or PC</em>
<pre>
Fix/endian -c ftp-ed_cray_file new_file
</pre>
   or simply do it in-place
<pre>
Fix/endian -i ftp-ed_cray_file
</pre>
   This converts the imported Cray binary file to a little-endian binary file,
   which can be read by VAC or IDL. 
<p>
   The most elegant way to transfer files between the Cray and your workstation
   is to use <b>rcp</b>. This requires the <b>.rhosts</b> files to be set and 
   the system managers to allow the remote copy. If it is not allowed, use FTP.
   On the Cray in Amsterdam it is allowed. It is a good idea to make aliases 
   in your .cshrc or .login similar to these:
<pre>
alias putc90 'rcp \!* USER@NODE:~USER/vac/\!*'
alias getc90 'rcp USER@NODE:~USER/vac/\!*'
</pre>
   Then you can simply say in the main vac directory
<pre>
putc90 data/exampleA22.out
getc90 par/MYPROBLEM par/
</pre>
Note that you can rename the file with <b>getc90</b> but not with 
<b>putc90</b>.

<H2><A NAME="SPT3E">Running</A> VAC on the IBM SP and CRAY T3E</H2>

<H4><A NAME="Limitations2">Limitations</A></h4>

   The implicit module should be switched off, since it is not parallel.
   For installing VAC on the Cray T3E in Delft,
   be aware that the gunzip command is not understood (one may use compress).

<H4><A NAME="Compilation">Compiling VAC</A></h4>

   For a single node VAC and VACINI can be compiled by the Fortran 90
   compilers the same way as for a work station. To compile a parallel
   version, however, use
<pre>
make vachpf
</pre>
   or rather set the default compiler to HPF in src/Makefile and set
   the -O flag in the VACPP=vacpp.pl -O definition, and simply use
   'make vac'.
<p>
   One should configure VAC to the actual grid size (-g=104,104 for a
   100 x 100 mesh) for a good load balance under HPF. The VAC preprocessor 
   <b>vacpp.pl</b> uses the <b>-O</b> flag to replace the 
   general index shifts to simpler ones, so that the HPF compilers can 
   produce efficient communication. 
   In case the VACUSR module also uses shifts, they should
   be written in a similar fashion as in the main code if a good performance
   is required. There is a description on the special <b>!SHIFT</b> comments 
   in Man/<A HREF="source.html#Special">source</A>.
<p>
   The <b>src/f90tohpf</b> script inserts the HPF distribution directives into
   the Fortran 90 code. You should set in the src/Makefile which 
   spatial index should be distributed using the <b>-distr</b> flag.
   According to our timings, in 2 and 3D it is best to distribute the 2nd 
   (-distr=2) or the 2nd and 3rd dimensions (-distr=23). By default the
   static arrays, such as grid coordinates, are not distributed to reduce
   communication time. In case you run out of the memory of individual nodes,
   the <b>-distrstatic</b> flag should be switched on (but note that
   for PGHPF 2.4-4 on the IBM SP there is a related <A HREF=bugs.html>bug</A>).
   Some PGHPF compilers have a bug related to the distribution directives,
   namely the distribution cannot be given with an "ONTO PP" statement.
   This bug can be avoided by setting the <b>-pghpf</b> flag, which 
   drops this statement and allows the compiler to use the default
   mapping strategy. If this bug is not present and more than one
   dimensions are distributed, the mapping to the processors can be
   defined explicitly in src/vacdef.t, e.g. 
<pre>
!HPF$ PROCESSORS PP(4,NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS()/4)
</pre>
   Numerical experiments indicated that distribution along one dimension
   is quite efficient. On the T3E distribution along the second dimension
   seems to be preferable to distribution in the first index.

<H4><A NAME="RunSP">Running VAC on the SP</A></h4>

   On the SP, make sure that the <b>.rhosts</b> file in the main
   directory contains all the nodes to be used. For the SP in Amsterdam
   this means that the ~/.rhosts file has to contain a line like
<pre>
+@isisnodes USERNAME
</pre>
   The namelists need to end with a / rather than &amp;end, thus you need
   to run the <b>Fix/end2slash</b> script on all parameter files by
<pre>
Fix/end2slash par/*
</pre>
   To run the code as a batch job, the following <b>Jobs/jobsp</b> script 
   can be used:
<pre>
#!/bin/sh
#@ job_type = parallel
#@ output = $(Cluster).$(Process).out
#@ error  = $(Cluster).$(Process).err
#@ requirements = Adapter == "hps_user"
#@ wall_clock_limit=0:10:30
#@ min_processors = 2
#@ max_processors = 2
#@ queue
set -x
export MP_EUILIB=us
echo Loadleveler processor list: $LOADL_PROCESSOR_LIST
#
poe $HOME/vac/vac_example &lt; par/exampleA22
</pre>
   The maximum time, which is 10.5 minutes here, and the number of processors 
   <b>min_processors, max_processors</b> should be set in a consistent fashion
   for the job. The last line of the script contains the executable 
   command executed through the Parallel Operating Environment <b>poe</b>. 
<p>
   The job is submitted to the LoadLeveler by 
<pre>
llsubmit jobvac
</pre>
   The LoadLeveler will give the job name in response, eg. 
   <b>isis-s113.867</b>. The status of the job can be checked by
<pre>
spq
spq -u
llq isis-s113.867
llq -u USERNAME
</pre>
   and the output and error messages are written into the files 
   <b>867.0.out</b> and <b>867.0.err</b>, respectively.
   The job can be cancelled by <b>llcancel isis-s113.867</b>.
   Check out the <b>spfree, spwhat, spwhen</b>, and <b>spusage</b> commands
   too.

<H4><A NAME="RunT3E">Running VAC on the T3E</A></h4>

   Like on the C90, the namelists should contain .true. and .false.
   instead of T and F, thus run 
<pre>
Fix/T2true par/*
</pre>
   The code can be run interactively on e.g. 2 nodes with the
<pre>
mpprun -n2 vac_example -pghpf -stat cpus &lt; par/exampleA22
</pre>
   command. The <b>-pghpf -stat cpus</b> flags give some info on the
   distribution of work among the CPU-s. To submit the job, use the NQS
   system with a script like <b>Jobs/jobt3e</b>
<pre>
#! /bin/sh
#QSUB -l p_mpp_t=60
#QSUB -l mpp_p=8
#QSUB
#
cd    $HOME/vac/
#
assign -F f77 g:su
#
mpprun -n8 vac_example -pghpf -stat cpus &lt; par/exampleA22
</pre>
The meaning of the flags is maximum execution time in seconds (-l p_mpp_t=) and
maximum number of processors (-l mpp_p=) requested. These flags may
be specific to the T3E in Delft.
<p>
The reading and writing of binary files that are compatible with other
computer platforms is not easy on the Cray T3E. First of all the
<pre>
assign -F f77 g:su
</pre>
command should be executed before VACINI or VAC runs. It is executed
in the above script as well. This ensures that
the data files are in UNIX Fortran format. Still, the integers are 8 byte
long, while on any other machine the integers occupy 4 bytes only.
The other possible difference can be in the endianness of the two machines.
The conversion can be done on the other machine (<em>not on the Cray!</em>) 
with the <A HREF=convert.html#Endian>Fix/endian</A> Perl script as
<pre>
Fix/endian -i ftp-ed-cray_file
</pre>
on a little-endian machine or
<pre>
Fix/endian -k -i ftp-ed_cray_file
</pre>
on a big-endian machine.

<H2><A NAME="Visualizing1">Visualizing</A> Results</h2>

   IDL, MATLAB and SM (SuperMongo) macros are provided to visualize results. 
   There are <A HREF="convert.html">conversion programs</A> for Gnuplot, 
   AVS, and DX. You may, of course, use any other visualization software, 
   as long as it can read the output files.
<p>

<h4><A NAME=IDL>Visualizing</A> with IDL</h4>

   The IDL macros support reading both ASCII and BINARY files, however
   IDL can read binary files much faster. Set <b>typefileout=binary</b> in
   your <b>par/PROBLEM</b> file. You may change the default setting in the
   <b>par/DEFAULT</b> file if you wish to use binary files all the time.
<p>
   Start IDL in the data directory
<pre>
cd data
idl idlrc
</pre>
Read Man/<A HREF="idl.html">idl</A> on how the initialization file
<b>idlrc</b> can be read without typing it explicitly.
<p>
   To read results of e.g. the 2nd saved snaphot type
<pre>
.r getpict
</pre>
   The macro will prompt you for filename and number of snapshot. Reply e.g.
<pre>
example22.out
3
</pre>
   The macro reads results into the x and w arrays. For the example
   shallow water simulations
<pre>
surface,w(*,*,0)
</pre>
   will plot surface height. See Man/<A HREF="idl.html">idl</A> on options 
   for plotting, animation, printing, or reading the logfile.

<h4><A NAME=MATLAB>Visualizing</A> with MATLAB</h4>

   The MATLAB macros support reading both ASCII and BINARY files, however
   MATLAB can read binary files faster. Set <b>typefileout=binary</b> in
   your <b>par/PROBLEM</b> file. You may change the default setting in the
   <b>par/DEFAULT</b> file if you wish to use binary files all the time.
<p>
   Define the <i>path</i> to the Matlab macros and start MATLAB 
<pre>
setenv MATLABPATH $HOME/vac/Matlab  # In C shell or tcsh
export MATLABPATH=$HOME/vac/Matlab  # In other UNIX shells
matlab
</pre>
Read Man/<A HREF="matlab.html">matlab</A> how the 
<i>path</i> can be set in e.g. the <b>.login</b> file.
<p>
   To read results of e.g. the 2nd saved snaphot type
<pre>
getpict
</pre>
   The macro will prompt you for filename and number of snapshot. Reply e.g.
<pre>
'data/PROBLEM'
2
</pre>
   The macro reads results into the arrays defined in the file header. 
   To plot the velocity field, you could type
<pre>
quiver(m1./rho,m2./rho)
</pre>
   See Man/<A HREF="matlab.html">matlab</A> on options for plotting, 
   animation, printing, or reading the logfile.

<h4><A NAME=SM>Visualizing</A> with SM</h4>

   <p>The SM macros can read ASCII files only, use <b>filetypeout=ascii</b> 
   in the <b>&amp;filelist</b> namelist of the <b>par/PROBLEM</b> parameter 
   file.
<p>
   Start SM (read Man/<A HREF="sm.html">sm</A> about installation and details 
   of use)
<pre>
sm
</pre>
   To plot results of e.g. the 2nd saved snaphot type at the : prompt of SM
<pre>
use PROBLEM
out 2
</pre>
   For a time history of e.g. average density, say
<pre>
plott rho
</pre>
   To exit SuperMongo type
<pre>
end
</pre>

<h4><A NAME=Gnuplot>Visualizing</A> with Gnuplot</h4>

First copy the script <b>cutpict</b> from the Gnuplot/ directory to data/:
<pre>
cp Gnuplot/cutpict data
</pre>
Then start Gnuplot in the data/ directory:
<pre>
cd data
gnuplot
</pre>
For 1D data type
<pre>
plot '&lt; cutpict -n=NPICT filename' using 1:NCOL with lines
</pre>
where NPICT and NCOL are integers indicating the snapshot and the variable.
For 2D data try
<pre>
set hidden3d
set data style lines
splot '&lt; cutpict -n=NPICT filename' using NCOL
</pre>
See Man/<A HREF=gnuplot.html>gnuplot</A> for more information.
