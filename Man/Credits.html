This software was developed by G&aacute;bor T&oacute;th at the Astronomical 
Institute at Utrecht from November 8 1994 to August 15 1997. 
The project is done in a collaboration with the FOM Institute for Plasma 
Physics, the Mathematics department at Utrecht and the CWI at Amsterdam. 
In particular, Rony Keppens (FOM), Mikhail Botchev (Mathematics Dept.), and
Auke van der Ploeg (CWI) contributed significantly to the development in 
the last year. Starting from August 15 1997, G. T&oacute;th and R. Keppens
share the responsibility and work associated with the development and
management of the software. 
<p>
The work has been funded by the Dutch Science Foundation (NWO) 
in a program of Massive Parallel Processing Applied to Magnetohydrodynamics,
and by the Dutch National Computing Facilities Foundation (NCF) for the use 
of supercomputer facilities.
G&aacute;bor T&oacute;th received partial support (grant F-017313, 1994-97)
from the Hungarian Science Foundation (OTKA) and he currently receives a 
postdoctoral position (No. D-25519, 1997-) from OTKA
and the Bolyai Fellowship (1997-) from Hungarian Academy of Sciences.
