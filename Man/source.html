VAC and VACINI are two separate programs for advancing and initializing the
flow, respectively. The two programs consist of several modules, some of them
are shared. Modules are simply sets of subroutines and functions that 
belong together and they are put in a single file. Due to the requirement of 
automatic translation to Fortran 77 these are not real Fortran 90 modules.
<p>
The main programs for VAC and VACINI are in the modules VAC and VACINI,
i.e. in the files <b>vac.t</b> and <b>vacini.t</b>, respectively. 
Input and output routines are in VACIO, used both by VAC and VACINI. 
Some special subroutines likely to be modified by the user are collected 
in <b>vacusr.t</b>. The VACUSR module has several variants in the 
<b>vacusr.t.PROBLEM</b> files, and <b>vacusr.t</b> is linked to 
(or copied from) one of them. This way the user(s) may compile VAC
and VACINI for specific problems differing in the VACUSR module only. 
<p>
Independence of equations is ensured by putting all flow variables in a 
single array <b>w</b>, and the variables are distinguished by their named 
indices, e.g. <b>w(ix1,ix2,rho_)</b> would read <b>rho(ix1,ix2)</b> in a 
typical code designed for a single equation. Here <b>rho_</b> is an integer 
parameter defined in the VACPAR module in the <b>vacpar.t</b> file, which is 
linked to (or copied from) the specific <b>vacpar.t.EQUATION</b> file. 
Thus the VACPAR module contains the EQUATION dependent parameters. 
The <b>vacusrpar.t</b> link to a <b>vacusrpar.t.PROBLEM</b> file contains the
extra PROBLEM dependent equation parameters. 
<p>
VACDEF contains the rest of the parameters and the common variables. 
<b>vacpar.t</b> and <b>vacusrpar.t</b> are included into <b>vacdef.t</b>, 
which is included into all subroutines and functions of VAC and VACINI. 
<p>
The VACPHYS0 module has several variants, <b>vacphys0.t</b> is a link to
(or a copy of) one of the <b>vacphys0.t.EQUATION</b> files. 
This module contains the most important equation dependent subroutines, 
which are available for VAC and VACINI as well.
The rest of the modules are used by VAC only. The VACPHYS module 
<b>vacphys.t</b> is a link to (or a copy of) one of the 
<b>vacphys.t.EQUATION</b> files. 
The VACPHYS module contains the remaining equation dependent subroutines which
are used by the different algorithms in VAC. 
<p>
The spatial discretization of the equations algorithms are divided into the 
VACCD, VACMC, VACTVDLF, VACTVD, and VACFCT modules. 
VACCD and VACMC contain the simple Central Differencing and
MacCormack schemes. These are mostly used as predictor or base steps.
The TVDLF, one step TVD and FCT schemes are in the respective
modules. The TVD-MUSCL scheme uses the VACTVDLF and VACTVD modules. 
The VACPOISSON module is a parallel Poisson solver, 
which is currently used by the projection scheme and the self-gravity library,
but it should be easy to call it from a user written subroutine too.
<p>
The explicit temporal discretizations are in the main VAC module <b>vac.t</b>.
VACIMPL and VACITER are dealing with implicit time integration schemes
and iterative methods, respectively. The iterative methods themselves are 
in Fortran 77 libraries, namely CONJGRAD, GMRESR, and TRIDIAG.
Consequently the implicit time integration is not parallelized.
<p>
Finally the VACGRID module takes care of initializing the grid related 
variables, and it contains all the predefined boundary conditions. 

<H2><A NAME="Syntax">Syntax</A></h2>

<ol><H4><A NAME="Dimensions"><li>Dimensions</A> and vector components</h4>

Since we aim to solve equations independent of the number of dimensions,
arrays with unknown number of dimensions have to be declared and manipulated.
This is achieved by the extensive use of the preprocessor VACPP. 
<p>
The basic idea of the Loop Annotation Syntax (LASY) is defining loops in 
the source text. A first example may be an array with 3 indices:
<pre>
a({ix^D|,})   ---&gt;     a(ix1,ix2,ix3)
</pre>
The string <b>ix^D</b> between the <b>{</b> and <b>|</b> characters is repeated
NDIM=3 times with the pattern string <b>^D</b> replaced by 
<b>1</b>, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>, 
and the three resulting strings are separated by the string between 
the <b>|</b> and <b>}</b> characters, in this case a single comma. As you 
may observe, some special characters are used to help the preprocessor in 
recognizing the loop. The loop is enclosed between curly brackets, the 
pattern consists of a <b>^</b> character followed by uppercase letters 
(or <b>%</b>, or <b>&amp;</b>), and the separator string is preceded by the 
<b>|</b> character. Thus the full syntax of the loop is
<pre>
{ text ^PATTERN text ^PATTERN ... | separator }
</pre>
Fortunately some default values can be introduced to simplify the notation.
The default separator is the comma, thus the above example can be written as
<b>a({ix^D})</b>. Furthermore the preprocessor can expand patterns without
enclosing curly brackets. When it sees a pattern, it looks for <i>bounding
characters</i> on both sides. These are one of <i>comma, space, newline, 
semicolon</i> and <i>enclosing parentheses</i>. 
Since our <b>^D</b> pattern is enclosed by a left 
and a right parenthesis, we may simply type
<pre>
a(ix^D)
</pre>
which will expand to <b>a(ix1)</b>, <b>a(ix1,ix2)</b>, and 
<b>a(ix1,ix2,ix3)</b> for the choices NDIM=1, 2, and 3, respectively. 
<p>
The curly brackets are used only when the repetition should expand over
some bounding characters. The required separator is very often a single 
character, such as in the calculation of sums or products:
<pre>
ix^D*    ---&gt;   ix1*ix2*ix3
</pre>
Here the <b>^D</b> pattern is enclosed by a new line and a space character, 
and the preprocessor checks the last character of the repeated string.
If it is one of comma, space, <b>+</b>, <b>-</b>, <b>*</b>, <b>/</b>, 
<b>:</b>, <b>;</b>, or <b>\</b>, it is taken to be a separator character. 
The <b>\</b> is replaced by a new line. A simple use may be nested DO loops:
<pre>
{do ix^D=1,100\}                    do ix1=1,100
   a(ix^D)= ix^D*       ---&gt;        do ix2=1,100
{enddo\}                            a(ix1,ix2)= ix1*ix2
                                    enddo
                                    enddo
</pre>
Here NDIM=2 was assumed. Note the need for curly brackets in the first line
to override the space and the comma, and also note the space in 
<b>a(ix^D)= ix^D*</b> which is needed to bound the <b>ix^D*</b> loop. 
In the final <b>{enddo\}</b> line the number of repetitions was assumed 
to be NDIM, as we shall see this may not always be the case. 
<p>
Suppose we want to assign the same value to NDIM variables: 
<pre>
ix^D=1;     ---&gt;     ix1=1;ix2=1;
</pre>
The semicolon is a bounding character, thus strictly speaking it does not 
belong to the <b>ix^D=1</b> loop. The preprocessor, however, checks wether the
right bounding character is a semicolon, and if it is, it becomes the
separator. The original trailing semicolon is also preserved, which turns out 
to be a useful feature.
<p>
Up to this point we used a single pattern <b>^D</b> only, which is replaced by
the numbers <b>1..NDIM</b>. During the code development it became 
obvious that the preprocessor can be used for many other things than repeated 
indices for the dimensions. The first new application is the components for
vector variables, which run from 1 to NDIR, and in general 
1&lt;=NDIM&lt;=NDIR&lt;=3.
The <b>^C</b> (mnemonic: Component as opposed to <b>^D</b> for Dimension) 
pattern is thus replaced by <b>1..NDIR</b>. When more than one pattern 
is found in a loop, the first one determines the number of repetitions, and 
only patterns with the same first letter are replaced by their substitutes.
<p>
Look at the following typical case construct for NDIM=2 and NDIR=2:
<pre>
select case(iw)
  {case(m^C_)
     mom(ixmin^D:ixmax^D)=w(ixmin^D:ixmax^D,m^C_) \}
end select

---&gt;

select case(iw)
  case(m1_)
     mom(ixmin^D:ixmax^D)=w(ixmin^D:ixmax^D,m1_)
  case(m2_)
     mom(ixmin^D:ixmax^D)=w(ixmin^D:ixmax^D,m2_)
end select

---&gt;

select case(iw)
  case(m1_)
     mom(ixmin1:ixmax1,ixmin2:ixmax2)=&amp;
        w(ixmin1:ixmax1,ixmin2:ixmax2,m1_)
  case(m2_)
     mom(ixmin1:ixmax1,ixmin2:ixmax2)=&amp;
        w(ixmin1:ixmax1,ixmin2:ixmax2,m2_)
end select
</pre>
Notice that the preprocessor first expanded the loop for the first <b>^C</b> 
pattern and substituted <b>^C</b> in the third index of the <b>w</b> array
but the other indices with the <b>^D</b> patterns were left alone. In the
second iteration the loops with <b>^D</b> patterns were expanded.
The resulting lines may become extremely long, thus the preprocessor 
breaks them into continuation lines.
<p>
<H4><A NAME="Limits,"><li>Limits</A>, segments, and nulpatterns</h4>
<p>
To further shorten the notation the often used <b>min^D</b> and <b>max^D</b> 
strings were interpreted as a loop of the <b>^L</b> pattern (mnemonic: Limits).
Yes, a pattern may expand into other pattern(s) thus producing another loop. 
To declare the limits of the array sections one may say
<pre>
integer:: ix^L  ---&gt;  integer:: ixmin^D,ixmax^D  ---&gt;

integer:: ixmin1,ixmin2,ixmax1,ixmax2
</pre>
The intermediate <b>^D</b> pattern becomes very important in the following 
typical example:
<pre>
jx^L=ix^L+kr(idim,^D);                                       ---&gt;

jxmin^D=ixmin^D+kr(idim,^D);jxmax^D=ixmax^D+kr(idim,^D);     ---&gt;

jxmin1=ixmin1+kr(idim,1);jxmin2=ixmin2+kr(idim,2);
jxmax1=ixmax1+kr(idim,1);jxmax2=ixmax2+kr(idim,2);
</pre>
The purpose is to shift the limits by 1 in the idim direction. The <b>kr</b> 
array is a Kronecker delta, it is 1 for the diagonal elements where the two 
indices are the same, and 0 otherwise. The <b>j</b> in the <b>jx</b> is the 
next letter in the alphabet after the <b>i</b>, thus <b>jx</b> is the mnemonic
for <b>ix</b><b>+</b><b>1</b>. Similarly <b>hx</b> is consistently used for 
<b>ix</b><b>-</b><b>1</b>.
The semicolon remains the separator for both loop expansions thanks to the 
trailing semicolon in the intermediate step.
Also note that the parentheses of <b>kr(idim,^D)</b> do not bound the initial
loop for <b>jx^L=...</b> because they do not enclose it. Once we get used to 
the notation it becomes natural to think of an <b>ix^L</b> type loop as a 
Pascal record or C structure consisting of 2, 4 or 6 integers. Therefore 
<b>^LADD</b>, <b>^LSUB</b> and <b>^LT</b> are introduced to do operations 
and comparisons on them. <b>^LADD</b> (mnemonic: add to limits) is replaced 
by <b>-</b> and <b>+</b> to decrease lower and increase upper limits, 
<b>^LSUB</b> does the opposite by expanding to <b>+</b> and <b>-</b>, 
finally <b>^LT</b> has substitutes <b>&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;</b> ensuring that 
the limits on the left are within the limits on the right. Thus we may extend
the <b>ix^L</b> limits by 1 with
<pre>
ix^L=ix^L^LADD1;  ---&gt;  ixmin^D=ixmin^D-1;ixmax^D=ixmax^D+1;

ixmin1=ixmin1-1;ixmin2=ixmin2-1;ixmax1=ixmax1+1;ixmax2=ixmax2+1;
</pre>
To check if the <b>ixI^L</b> input limits are not narrower than the 
<b>ix^L</b> limits
<pre>
if(ixI^L^LTix^L|.or.|.or.)stop ---&gt;

if(ixImin^D&gt;ixmin^D|.or. .or. ixImax^D&lt;ixmax^D|.or.)stop  ---&gt;

if(ixImin1&gt;ixmin1.or.ixImin2&gt;ixmin2 .or. ixImax1&lt;ixmax1.or.&amp;
   ixImax2&lt;ixmax2)stop
</pre>
where note the repeated use of the <b>.or.</b> separator string. 
<p>
It is possible to form array sections from the <b>^L</b> pattern by making use
of the <b>:</b> as a separator, but it turns out that introducing the new 
patterns <b>^LIM</b> (mnemonic: three letter LIMits min and max) and 
<b>^S</b> (mnemonic: Sections) is a better solution. The typically internally 
used <b>^LIM</b> pattern expands to <b>min</b> and <b>max</b>, 
while <b>^S</b> expands to <b>^LIM1:..^LIMndim:</b>, and therefore
<pre>
a(ix^S)  ---&gt;  a(ix^LIM1:,ix^LIM2:)  ---&gt;  a(ixmin1:ixmax1,ixmin2:ixmax2)
</pre>
As you may suspect the whole exercise of introducing <b>^LIM</b> and <b>^S</b>
served the purpose of achieving this extremely compact notation for array 
sections. In array declarations the <b>lo</b> and <b>hi</b> absolute limits 
are used instead of the <b>min</b> and <b>max</b> actual limits. 
The <b>^LL</b> pattern (mnemonic: Lowest/highest Limits) thus expands to 
<b>lo^D</b> and <b>hi^D</b> similarly to <b>^L</b>,
while <b>^LLIM</b> gives simply <b>lo</b> and <b>hi</b>, and <b>^T</b> 
(mnemonic: total segment) is used in most array declarations:
<pre>
a(ix^T)  ---&gt;  a(ix^LLIM1:,ix^LLIM2:)  ---&gt;  a(ixlo1:ixhi1,ixlo2:ixhi2)
</pre>
Now that we have many different patterns with different number of substitutes
it becomes useful and necessary to introduce patterns which are replaced by
nulstrings, but they determine the number and kind of substitutions. 
The <b>^D&amp;</b> and <b>^C&amp;</b> patterns produce NDIM and NDIR 
repetitions respectively. (The alternative names ^DLOOP and ^CLOOP can
also be used to avoid syntax problems at the end of a line, where the
&amp; means continuation according to FORTRAN 90.)
A trivial application is the enddo-s at the end of NDIM nested do loops:
<pre>
enddo^D&amp;;     ---&gt;    enddo;enddo;
</pre>
Obviously the <b>^D</b> pattern would not work here: 
<b>enddo^D; --&gt; enddo1;enddo2;</b>.
For scalar products of vector variables the <b>^C&amp;</b> is used at the 
head of the loops to tell VACPP that first the <b>^C</b> patterns should be 
expanded. For example calculate the magnetic pressure from the 
<b>pb=0.5*B.B</b> formula:
<pre>
pb(ix^S)=0.5*(^C&amp;w(ix^S,b^C_)**2+)   ---&gt;

pb(ixmin1:ixmax1)=0.5*(w(ixmin1:ixmax1,b1_)**2+w(ixmin1:ixmax1,b2_)**2)
</pre>
for NDIM=1, NDIR=2. The interpretation of the original code is easiest by
thinking of <b>^C&amp;</b> as the index for the loop and of the <b>+</b> 
at the end as the operator applied for the elements. 
<p>
<H4><A NAME="Breaking"><li>Breaking</A> the symmetry</h4>
<p>
The symmetry of the indices is sometimes broken. In the code it is
mostly related to the assumption of axial symmetry, when the first dimension
becomes special. The rest of the dimensions and sections are expanded from 
the <b>^DE</b> (mnemonic: Dimensions Extra) and <b>^SE</b> (Sections Extra) 
patterns. The radial distance may be related to the <b>x</b> coordinate 
array by
<pre>
r(ix^LIM1:)=x(ix^LIM1:,ixmin^DE,1)   ---&gt;

r(ixmin1:ixmax1)=x(ixmin1:ixmax1,ixmin2,ixmin3,1)
</pre>
then <b>r</b> may be a weight function for an array 
<pre>
forall(ix= ix^LIM1:) a(ix,ix^SE)=r(ix)*a(ix,ix^SE)      ---&gt;

forall(ix= ixmin1:ixmax1) a(ix,ixmin2:ixmax2)=r(ix)*a(ix,ixmin2:ixmax2)
</pre>
If NDIM=1 the preprocessor removes the separator, in this case a comma in the 
<b>ix,ix^SE</b> string, and the <b>ix^SE</b> loop is repeated 0 times, 
thus we get <b>forall(ix= ixmin1:ixmax1) a(ix)=r(ix)*a(ix)</b> as expected.
<p>
Another type of symmetry breaking occurs when something is done for all the
indices separately, e.g. the boundary elements of an NDIM dimensional array
are filled up for each boundary separately. The <b>^D%</b> pattern is 
replaced by <b>^%1..^%NDIM</b> patterns. The <b>^%N</b> pattern 
substitutes the text in front of it in the N-th repetition, and the text 
behind in the other substitutions. In general 
<b>head^%Ntail ---&gt; tail,..,tail,head,tail,..,tail</b> with <b>head</b> 
being at the N-th position. The number of repetitions is determined by the 
first pattern in <b>head</b> and <b>tail</b>. Here is an application for 
boundary conditions with <b>ixB^L</b> enclosing the boundary region and 
<b>ixMmin^D</b> being the edge of the mesh:
<pre>
{case(^D)
   do ix= ixBmin^D,ixBmax^D
      a(ix^D%ixB^S)=a(ixMmin^D^D%ixB^S)
   end do \}

---&gt; /loop for ^D/

case(1)
   do ix= ixBmin1,ixBmax1
      a(ix^%1ixB^S)=a(ixMmin1^%1ixB^S)
   end do
case(2)
   do ix= ixBmin2,ixBmax2
      a(ix^%2ixB^S)=a(ixMmin2^%2ixB^S)
   end do

---&gt; /loops for ^S taking ^%1 and ^%2 into account/

case(1)
   do ix= ixBmin1,ixBmax1
      a(ix,ixB^LIM2:)=a(ixMmin1,ixB^LIM2:)
   end do
case(2)
   do ix= ixBmin2,ixBmax2
      a(ixB^LIM1:,ix)=a(ixB^LIM1:,ixMmin2)
   end do

---&gt; /loops for ^LIM/

case(1)
   do ix= ixBmin1,ixBmax1
      a(ix,ixBmin2:ixBmax2)=a(ixMmin1,ixBmin2:ixBmax2)
   end do
case(2)
   do ix= ixBmin2,ixBmax2
      a(ixBmin1:ixBmax1,ix)=a(ixBmin1:ixBmax1,ixMmin2)
   end do
</pre>
<H4><A NAME="Special"><li>Special</A> features: switches, include files,
common variables, and index shifts</h4>
<p>
Depending on the actual use of VAC some subroutines may or may not be present,
thus any reference for calling the subroutine has to be eliminated, even
if that part of the program is not intended to be used. A pattern with 1 or 0
repetitions can just do that, thus 
<pre>
{^IFTVD call tvd(w)}  -->  call tvd(w)    or      ''
</pre>
i.e. a nulstring, depending on the value of <b>$if_tvd=1</b> or <b>0</b> 
in <b>vacpp.pl</b>, which is set by the script <b>setvac</b> depending on 
its flags <b>-on=tvd</b> or <b>-off=tvd</b>.
Certain subroutines are not used at all in 1D, or they may be needed only 
in 2D, the <b>^NOONED</b>, <b>^IFTWOD</b> etc. switches are used to make 
a part of the code conditional on the value of the NDIM parameter.
<p>
Another way of switching between different versions of some part of the code 
is including a file <b>filename.t</b> which can be a link to the particular 
realization. The following expression, placed to the beginning of the line,
<pre>
INCLUDE:filename
</pre>
will be replaced by the content of the file. Include files can be nested.
The INCLUDE: statement is often combined with conditional pattern(s).
<pre>
INCLUDE:vacproc.projectb.t^NOONED^IFPOISSON
</pre>
means that the projection scheme is only included if NDIM&gt;1 <i>and</i>
if the VACPOISSON module is on. There is a restriction, which follows
from the simple syntax rules: two conditional patterns can only be 
combined if their initial letters differ.
<p>
Having a powerful preprocessor one is tempted to eliminate all the annoying
repetitions inherent in the restricted Fortran 90 syntax. Variables in
common blocks have to be defined twice, once giving their type, and once
listing them in the common blocks. It would be very convenient to give them
a <b>COMMON</b> attribute in the type declaration and that's exactly what VACPP
lets you do if you insert 'COMMON,' to the beginning of the line:
<pre>
COMMON, INTEGER:: a(10),b
COMMON, LOGICAL:: l
COMMON, INTEGER:: c(20)

---&gt;

INTEGER:: a,b
LOGICAL:: l
INTEGER:: c
COMMON /INTE/  a(10),b, c(20)
COMMON /LOGI/  l
</pre>
The dimensions are stripped from the array declarations, and they are
declared in the <b>COMMON /NAME/</b> blocks collected at the end of the file.
The <b>/NAME/</b> is the first four letters of the type, thus only variables of
identical types get into the same common block, which avoids alignment 
problems.
<p>
To help the High Performance Fortran (HPF) compilers, the preprocessor
with the optimization flag set (<b>vacpp.pl -O</b>) can expand general 
index shifts, like the ones shown above, to IF, ELSEIF, ELSE constructs 
and simple shifts if enough information is given in form of special !SHIFT 
comments. For example the following flux additions in the idim direction
<pre>
!SHIFT
jx^L=ix^L+kr(idim,^D);
!SHIFT MORE
hx^L=ix^L-kr(idim,^D);

call getflux(w,f)
!SHIFT BEGIN
w(ix^S)=w(ix^S)+dt*(f(ix^S)-f(hx^S))
call getflux(w,f)
w(ix^S)=w(ix^S)+dt*(f(jx^S)-f(ix^S))
!SHIFT END
</pre>
are translated to a rather lengthy Fortran 90 code in 2 dimensions:
<pre>
!SHIFT

jxmax1=ixmax1+kr(idim,1);jxmax2=ixmax2+kr(idim,2);

Clearly, as long as the indices are shifted by 1 in the 1st or 2nd direction,
the code uses the first and second branches of the IF construct, so all the
shifts are written out in simple terms. The last ELSE branch is there for 
safety, it is the code that <b>vacpp.pl</b> would produce with no optimization.
<p>
A related topic is that <b>f90tohpf</b> distinguishes between 
<b>ixG^T</b> and <b>IXG^T</b>. Arrays declared with the latter capitalized
version are not distributed among the processors. This is useful for
arrays like <b>x, dx, volume</b> etc., since they do not change during
the calculation. Replicating these static arrays for each processor 
improves the performance of VAC on parallel machines. If the replication
is not possible, because of memory exhaustion, the <b>-distrstatic</b>
flag will force <b>f90tohpf</b> to distribute all the arrays, 
irrespective the capitalization of ixG.
<p>
In general, the first variable shift should be preceeded by the !SHIFT comment,
other shifts in the <em>same</em> dimension (but possibly
in the opposite direction) should be preceeded by the !SHIFT MORE comment.
The section that uses the shifted indices should be enclosed between 
!SHIFT BEGIN and !SHIFT END comments. Note that the !SHIFT... comments
are only recognized in capital letters.
