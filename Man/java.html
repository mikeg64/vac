<h1>JAVASCRIPT FOR ANIMATION</h1>

There is a simple Javascript <b>Movie/animate.html</b>, which can
be used to animate a series of GIF images with a JAVASCRIPT capable
browser. The main purpose is to provide animation features similar
to those of an <b>mpeg_play</b> program. Commercial visualization
softwares (such as IDL) can provide far superior animation.
<p>
The Javascript assumes that the snapshots are called <b>1.gif, 2.gif, ...</b>
First set the number of frames to be animated then load the images.
The Javascript player starts the animation automatically. The animation
can be speeded up, slowed down, reversed, swinged back and forth, stopped, 
or watched frame by frame by clicking on the appropriate buttons 
(similarly to a typical mpeg movie player).
<p>
If there are more directories containing GIF images, a new series of images
can be loaded after setting the directory and the number of frames.
Some of the default or starting values can be easily modified in the file
<b>Movie/animate.html</b>.
