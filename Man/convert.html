<h1>DATA FILE CONVERSION PROGRAMS</h1>

This document describes the use of the <b>convertdata, src/vacusr.real4io.t,
src/vacusr.t.real4io, Fix/endian, dec2ieee</b>, and  <b>ieee2dec</b>, 
to convert data files for 
different purposes, such as conversion between VAC ASCII, binary and real*4
formats, between binary formats for different machines, to produce data files
readable by DX and AVS for visualization, to extract an arbitrary
set of snapshots from a data file, and to convert them in a user defined way.

<H2><A NAME="Convertdata">Convertdata</A></H2>

The <b>convertdata</b> program can convert between binary and ASCII 
formats of VAC data files, and it can convert to AVS and DX ascii or
binary data formats using the LOVER library. The LOVER library is a
product of <A HREF="mailto:belien@rijnh.nl">A.J.C. Beli&euml;n</A>, 
please contact him with problems specific to the library.
The program can select an arbitrary set of snapshots, which should be read 
from the input file, in a fairly simple fashion. 
The user can define an arbitrary manipulation of data and an arbitrary file
format in the <b>savespecial</b> subroutine of the <b>src/convertusr.f</b> 
file.

<h3>Installation of the LOVER library</h3>

If conversion to AVS and/or Data Explorer (DX) file formats is desired,
first you need to install the LOVER library. Go into <b>src/AVSDX</b>
and execute
<pre>
sh lover.uu
</pre>
Select the type of workstation, and reply to the questions about the
top, library, and include directories by
<pre>
.
./lib
./include
</pre>
After a successful installation you may remove the <b>AVSDX/lover/</b>
directory, and some other files
<pre>
rm lover.tar install.lover
rm -rf lover
</pre>
If you do not want to use AVS or DX, but you want to use the <b>convertdata</b>
program for file conversion, you will need to edit the <b>src/Makefile</b> and
select the <em>No AVS/DX</em> options before compiling.

<h3>User Defined Transformation and File Format</h3>

An arbitrary data transformation and file format can be put into
the <b>savespecial</b> subroutine of <b>src/convertusr.f</b>.
You can start by copying the <b>src/convertusr.f.nul</b> file into
<b>src/convertusr.f.MINE</b>, then modify it according to your needs, 
and finally link it as
<pre>
ln -s convertusr.f.MINE convertusr.f  
</pre>
or simply copy it to convertusr.f, and compile
<pre>
make convertdata
</pre>
When the 'savespecial' subroutine is called, 
the file header information and the <b>x</b> and <b>w</b>
arrays have already been read from the actual snapshot of the input file. 
It is the responsibility of the user to save the desired information into
the output file. Simple examples are saving only some of the
variables, or transforming the conservative variables to primitive
variables, or transforming a polar grid to Cartesian coordinates, etc. etc.
The <b>src/convertusr.f.cut</b> file is a good example which can 
actually be useful. It can cut out a part of the computational domain
as described <A HREF=#CUT>below</A>.
The 'savespecial' subroutine is called only if 'special' is given as the 
output file format, otherwise it is not used.

<h3>Compilation and Usage of convertdata</h3>

The program is compiled by a Fortran 77 compiler
<pre>
cd src
make convertdata
cd ..
</pre>
This has to be done only once, since <b>convertdata</b> can read any VAC
data file irrespective of the number of dimensions or number of variables.
There are restrictions on the total size of the data in a single snapshot,
and the number of snapshots in a file. The default values are quite large,
but you can always change the value of <b>worksize, npictmax</b>, and 
<b>verbose</b> parameters in <b>src/convertdef.f</b> and recompile 
<b>convertdata</b> if necessary. 
<p>
To convert a data file, just run the code and reply to the questions. 
E.g. to convert an ASCII data file to a binary file type
<pre>
convertdata
Input file name:
data/example22.out
 ...
 BINARY FILE
 snapshot size =      100286 bytes

Which snapshots should be read?
 example string: 1,3,4,6:10:2,13:100
 hit RETURN for the whole file
1,4:7,10:20:2
Output file format
(ascii/binary/real4/AVSbin/AVSxdr/DXbin/DXasc/special):
binary
Output file name (different from input file name):
data/exampleA22bin.ini
 Converting snapshot    1
 Converting snapshot    4
 Converting snapshot    5
 Converting snapshot    6
 Converting snapshot    7
 Converting snapshot   10
 Converting snapshot   12
 Converting snapshot   14
 Converting snapshot   16
 Converting snapshot   18
 Converting snapshot   20
Data conversion finished.
</pre>
The type of the input file is determined automatically. If that failed
(e.g. on a Cray), you can still give the input file type explicitly.
The size of one snapshot can help in determining the number of snapshots in 
the file. If the file contains more than one snapshot, by default (when you 
hit return) all snapshots are read and converted. You can select some of the 
snapshots by answering the question with a string containing <em>segments</em>
which are separated by commas. The example above contains all the three 
types of segments: single frame defined by a number, a range of frames
defined by two numbers separated with a colon, and a range of frames 
with a stride, defined by three numbers separated by colons.
You may list as many segments as you wish, their order is arbitrary.
The output file will always contain the selected snapshots in their original 
order. References to nonexistent snapshots are ignored.
<p>
To produce a binary file for AVS or DX, you could type
<pre>
data/example22.out
 ...
Which snapshots should be read?
 ...
1:21
Output file format
(ascii/binary/real4/AVSbin/AVSxdr/DXbin/DXasc/special):
AVSbin
Output file name (without the .dx or .fld extension):
data/example22
 physics = hdadiab
 nx1= 100 nx2= 100 nx3=   1 ndim=2 ndir=2
Format for output (ascii/binary/xdr FOR AVS ON CRAY):
binary
 ...
 Converting snapshot    1
 Converting snapshot    2
 ...
 Converting snapshot   21
Data conversion finished.
</pre>
The result is in <b>data/example22.fld</b>, and if you chose <b>DX</b>
as the output format it would be in <b>data/example22.dx</b>.
<p>
<em>Note that the XDR format should only be used when AVS is run on a Cray
and the output file is to be used on a work station.  
The ASCII format is available for DX only.</em>
<p>
The variable names in the output files, <b>rho, M, e</b>, and <b>B</b> for DX 
and <b>rho, M1, M2, M3, e</b>, and <b>B1, B2, B3</b> for AVS, are fixed.
According to the manual for LOVER, the files can be read into DX by the
<b>Import</b> module, while into AVS by the <b>Read Field</b> module
and <b>extract scalar</b> or <b>extract vector</b> should be used.
<p>
<A NAME=CUT>As</A> a final example, the usage of the 
<b>src/convertusr.f.cut</b> file is described. 
First of all, the file should be linked and convertdata recompiled:
<pre>
cd src
ln -s convertusr.f.cut convertusr.f
make convertcdata
cd ..
</pre>
Suppose that you wish to cut out the middle plane orthogonal to the Y axis from
the first 3 snapshots of a 3D hydrodynamic simulation, which was done on a 
50 x 50 x 100 grid and the result is stored in <b>data/big33.out</b>. 
Then type
<pre>
convertdata
Input file name:
data/big33.out
 headline      =Big_hd33                
 it, t         = 15000  814.279651
 ndim,neqpar,nw= 3 1 5
 nx            = 50 50 100
 eqpar         =  1.4
 varnames      =x y z rho m1 m2 m3 e   gamma        
 ...
Which snapshots should be read?
1:3
Output file format
(ascii/binary/real4/AVSbin/AVSxdr/DXbin/DXasc/special):
special
Output file name (different from input file name):
data/cut23
 Converting snapshot    1
 Give ixcutmin,ixcutmax for each dimensions:
1 50 25 25 1 100
 ncutdim, icutdim: 2 1 3
 fileheadout = Big_hd23
 varnamesout = x z rho m1 m2 m3 e   gamma
 Converting snapshot    2
 Converting snapshot    3
Data conversion finished.
</pre>
Here <b>ncutdim=2</b> means that the cut is two dimensional parallel with
the <b>icutdim=1 3</b> axes since <b>ixcutmin=ixcutmax=25</b> 
was entered for the second dimension. 
The lower dimensionality (ndim=2) and the new grid size (nx=50 100) 
are reflected in the output file header. The 1st and 5th lines are also
changed: <b>fileheadout</b> contains '_hd23' instead of '_hd33',
and <b>varnamesout</b> contains the coordinate names 'x z'
instead of 'x y z'. Of course, the output file contains only the 1st and 3rd
coordinates from the original 3D file.

<H2><A NAME="Real4">Single Precision Data Files</A></H2>

VAC and VACINI can read and write single precision data files directly, without
the need of using <A HREF=#Convertdata>convertdata</A>. During the 
calculations the reals are always represented with 8 bytes, so using 
4 byte data files loses some of the precision. This is tolerable if the
output data files are meant for visualization, and not for a restart. 
The REAL*4 format approximately halfens the file sizes.
<p>
Before compiling VAC and VACINI, use
<pre>
setvac -u=real4io
</pre>
to select the VACUSR file <b>src/vacusr.t.real4io</b> which simply includes
the library subroutines in <b>src/vacusr.real4io.t</b> whith an INCLUDE:
statement. If you are already using your own VACUSR module (e.g. for 
the source terms, initial or boundary conditions) then just replace
the line 'INCLUDE:vacnul.specialio.t' by
<pre>
INCLUDE:vacusr.real4io.t
</pre>
in your src/vacusr.t.PROBLEM file. 
<p>
In either case, a single precision input file can be read or written by the
recompiled VAC and VACINI executables if <b>typefileini</b> and/or 
<b>typefileout</b> are set to the value <b>'special'</b>. 
See Man/<A HREF=inipar.html#Filetype>inipar</A> and 
Man/<A HREF=par.html#Filelist>par</A>.

<H2><A NAME="Endian">Fix/endian</A></H2>

The <b>Fix/endian</b> Perl script solves many of the problems of 
transporting binary VAC data files between different platforms.
The script can tell whether a machine is a big endian or little
endian (these differ in the ordering of bytes for integers and reals),
and it can test and convert the endianness of VAC binary data files,
both in double and single precisions. As an additional benefit,
the 8-byte integers used by Cray can be converted to 4 byte integers
and vice-versa.
<p>
Note that the 'assign -F f77 g:su' or 'assign -F f77 u=12' command has to be 
used on the Cray before running VAC, so that the output file is in Fortran 77 
format. Then the file should be FTP-d to a workstation/PC, and the 
Fix/endian script should be executed there. The script does not work on
the Cray, because even the Perl interpreter is non-standard on a Cray.
<p>
Tpye <b>Fix/endian</b> without any parameters to see the syntax of usage.
An example of usage is to check the content of a data file with the
<b>-t</b> flag (test):
<pre>
Fix/endian -t data/example22.out

This is a little endian machine.

data/example22.out is a little endian double precision file.

headline=Kelvin-Helmholtz-instability_hdadiab22                                
it=0 t=0 ndim=2 neqpar=3 nw=3
nx=100,100
eqpar=2,7.5,0
names=x y rho m1 m2   gamma adiab   coriolis                                

file=8406006 bytes / snapshot=400286 bytes = 21 snapshot(s)
</pre>

<H2><A NAME="Dec2ieee">dec2ieee and ieee2dec</A></H2>

<i>Fix/endian is more versatile than dec2ieee and ieee2dec</i>
<p>
The DEC workstations and IBM compatible personal computers (PC) 
tend to use little-endian integers, while other 
workstations or the Cray C90 use big-endian integers. This annoying little
difference can be cured by the two codes compiled by a DEC Fortran 90 
compiler that has the <b>-convert</b> flag:
<pre>
cd src
make dec2ieee
make ieee2dec
cd ..
</pre>
The executables <b>dec2ieee</b> and <b>ieee2dec</b> 
(they would be better named <i>little2big</i> and <i>big2little</i>,
but it would be difficult to remember which is which) will be in the main
directory. They can read any binary VAC data files, irrespective of number 
of dimensions, number of variables, or even size. To convert a binary file 
produced on a DEC workstation to a file which can be read on another 
workstation or the Cray, just type
<pre>
dec2ieee &lt; data/DECDATAFILE &gt; data/NEWDATAFILE
</pre>
Conversion backwards is equally simple
<pre>
ieee2dec &lt; data/OLDDATAFILE &gt; data/DECDATAFILE
</pre>
Remember that the Cray does not use IEEE and UNIX file format as a default.
