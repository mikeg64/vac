<h2>Precompilation and Compilation Problems</h2>

<h4>Problems with the preprocessor VACPP</h4>

The preprocessor creates very long lines when it expands the <b>*.t</b>
files. It attempts to break the lines at appropriate places, it
may however fail to do so. Some Fortran compilers may
complain about such continuation lines. The best you can do is 
breaking the ORIGINAL source line into smaller pieces or add spaces
to the line to help VACPP in breaking the line. This problem
may occur for some specific <b>ndim</b> and <b>ndir</b> values, as they modify 
the lengths of the lines. Since I improved the line breaking algorithm,
this seems to happen very rarely. 

<h4>Problems with the User Interface</h4>

Occasionally the <b>weblink</b> server creates lots of idling processes which 
may result in <b>alert statements</b> of the shell. 
The reason for this is not known, it is probably some faulty interaction of 
Weblink and the operating system. If this occured, simply exit <b>weblink</b> 
by clicking at the EXIT button, which will kill all the idling processes too, 
and then you can restart the user interface again.
If for some reason you exited weblink in another way 
(<em>which should not be done</em>), kill the weblink process with 
<b>kill -9</b>, this will kill the associated idling processes too.

<h2>VAC Problems</h2>

<h4>The Courant condition for FCT in generalized coordinates</h4>

The Courant condition is not checked accurately for the FCT method
when generalized coordinates are used. The reason is that FCT does never
rotate the variables into the local coordinate system of the cells.
The approximate calculation may be sufficient, or use smaller Courant number,
or fixed time step, or TVD-type methods.

<h4>The Courant condition in the first time step for TVD-type methods</h4>

For TVD type methods the Courant condition is based on the eigenvalues at 
the interfaces at the <em>previous</em> time step during the calculation.
Assuming that the maximum eigenvalue does not change more than 20% in one
time step, this keeps the CFL condition if C=0.8 is set. For the very first
time step, however, <b>dt</b> is estimated from the maximum eigenvalue in the
cell center. For some initial conditions this may produce a CFL condition
violation in the first time step, which usually can be ignored, or you can
start the calculation with doing a few time steps with a smaller Courant 
number using the <A HREF="par.html#Paramlist"><b>slowsteps</b></A> parameter.

<h4>Third order TVD-MUSCL scheme</h4>

Though in principle the TVD-MUSCL scheme is spatially third order accurate 
with <b>muscleta=1/3</b> and <b>musclomega=4</b> set, there is little use
of it due to the following problems: at extrema the TVD scheme is still only
first order accurate (this may be cured by TVBounded schemes) and 
none of the present time integration schemes (i.e. the default Hancock 
predictor or the higher order Runge-Kutta schemes) seem to keep the TVD 
property if <b>musclomega</b> is not 1.
