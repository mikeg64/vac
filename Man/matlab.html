<h1>MATLAB VISUALIZATION MACROS</h1>

This document briefly describes the use of MATLAB for plotting results from 
VAC. MATLAB is not a free software, it is distributed by The Maths Works Inc.
<p>
The MATLAB macros provided for VAC are all in the <b>Matlab</b> directory.
<p>
<em>Hans De Sterck is acknowledged for providing the Matlab macros 
developed for his Emma_D code, which were based on an early version of the VAC 
IDL procedures.</em>

<H2><A NAME="Startup">Installation</A></H2>

   To let MATLAB know where the macros are, put 
<pre>
setenv MATLABPATH $HOME/vac/Matlab
</pre>
   into your ~/.login or ~/.cshrc file if your UNIX shell is csh or tcsh,
   and put
<pre>
MATLABPATH=$HOME/vac/Matlab
export MATLABPATH
</pre>
   in the <b>.profile</b> file if you use a different UNIX shell.
   Also type this on the command line if this is the first time that you
   want to use the Matlab macros (thus .login, .cshrc, or .profile has not 
   been executed yet). Read the MATLAB manual if your operating system is 
   not UNIX.
<p>
<H2><A NAME="Running">Running</A> MATLAB</H2>

   To start MATLAB type 
<pre>
matlab
</pre>
   in the main VAC directory. The <b>Matlab/startup.m</b> file is executed
   which shows some basic information and also runs <b>Matlab/defaults.m</b>
   to initialize some global variables. You may get help on any functions
   or scripts by typing help and the name, e.g.
<pre>
help get_func
</pre>
   To exit MATLAB type <kbd>quit</kbd> or
<pre>
exit
</pre>
<H2><A NAME="Getpict">Reading</A> a Snapshot with getpict</H2>

   To read a single snapshot from a file, type at the <b>&gt;&gt;</b>
   prompt of MATLAB
<pre>
getpict
</pre>
   The procedure will prompt you for the value of <b>filename</b>, 
   and it determines the file type (ASCII or binary), the size of the 
   file <b>filesize</b>, and the size of one snapshot <b>pictsize</b>
   (both in bytes) automatically. 
   From the two sizes the number of snapshots in the file <b>npictinfile</b> 
   is calculated and displayed. Then the user is asked for the frame-number 
   <b>npict</b> (1,2,..) of the snapshot to be read from the file:
<pre>
filename(s)  ? 'data/exampleA22.ini'
asciifile(s) =1

npictinfile(s)              =1
npict(s) (eg. 2 or [3 4 5])? 1
</pre>
   The header of the file is read and echoed on the screen, and the
   type of equation <b>physics</b> is determined <em>if</em> it is 
   defined in the headline of the file, e.g. here <b>ExampleA_hdadiab22</b> 
   (you can also set <kbd>physics='hdadiab22'</kbd> explicitly). From
   <b>physics</b> two further variables are derived: <b>phys</b> from which
   the 2 numbers at the the end are chopped off and the number of vector 
   components <b>ndir</b> which is the last character of <b>physics</b>.
<pre>
headline='ExampleA'
physics ='hdadiab22'
it=0 time=0.000000 ndim=2 neqpar=3 nw=3
eqpar=[2 1 0]
nx   =[50 50]
Reading:x y h m1 m2   gamma ghalf coriolis
</pre>
   The coordinates, the conservative variables, and the equation parameters
   are read from the file, and they are defined as Matlab matrices with 
   names listed in the 4-th line of the file header as defined in the 
   inipar file. The original data, as read from the file, is contained
   in the <b>X, w</b>, and <b>eqpar</b> arrays.
<p>
   You can read snapshots from more than one files for purposes of
   comparison. Simply give the filenames separated by spaces, and the 
   frame-numbers (if they differ) as a matlab array, e.g.
<pre>
defaults
getpict
filename(s) ? 'data/exampleA22.ini data/example22.out'
asciifile(s) =[1 0]

npictinfile(s)              =[1 21]
npict(s) (eg. 2 or [3 4 5])? [1 4]
</pre>
   The coordinates, conservative variables and equation parameters
   will be put into variables named as before, except that <b>_1, _2, ...</b> 
   are appended to the names to distinguish between the data read from 
   different files.
   The header information, which is printed for each files onto the screen, 
   will be overwritten by the last file read, in this case it will belong to
   <b>data/example22.out</b>. The non-suffixed <b>x, y, h, ..., gamma, ...</b> 
   matrices will also be set by the data read from the last file, and this is 
   what <A HREF=#Plotfunc>plotfunc</A> uses to produce the plots.
<p>
   It is worthwhile to note that MATLAB can read binary data files faster
   than formatted ASCII files. Set <b>typefileout='binary'</b> in your 
   <A HREF="par.html#Filelist">par/PROBLEM</A> file to produce binary output
   files. Use the <b>typefileout</b> action in the 
   <A HREF="inipar.html#Filetype">inipar/PROBLEM</A> parameter file to produce
   binary initial data by VACINI. 
<p>
   If the file contained data on a Cartesian grid, you get the 
   prompt back and you can do whatever you want with 
   <b>h, h_1, h_2, m1, m1_1, m1_2, ...</b> and all the other variables 
   <b>headline, it, time, gencoord, ndim, neqpar, nw, nx</b>
   defined by the file header. 
<p>
   You can use the <A HREF=#Plotfunc>plotfunc</A> script to get some 
   sophisticated plots or you can use any of the MATLAB procedures directly, 
   e.g.
<pre>
plot(h(:,25))
surf(h_2-h_1)
contour(h)
quiver(m1./h,m2./h)
</pre>
   The functions <b>gradx</b> and <b>grady</b> are provided for taking spatial
   derivatives of variables represented on a 2D Cartesian mesh. 
   To calculate and plot the curl of the velocity field you could type
<pre>
curl_v=gradx(m1./h,x)-grady(m2./h,y);
contour(curl_v)
</pre>
   You can also use <b>gradx</b> and <b>grady</b> in the 
   <b>Matlab/get_func.m</b> script to define functions plotted by 
   <b>plotfunc</b> and <b>animate</b>. The <b>grad4x, grad4y</b> 
   functions calculate fourth order derivatives on a uniform Cartesian
   grid.

<H2><A NAME="Generalized">Transformation</A> from Generalized Coordinates</H2>

   If the file contains generalized coordinates, which is signaled by a 
   negative <b>ndim</b> in the file, and by the variable <b>gencoord=1</b> 
   in MATLAB, the <b>getpict</b> macro will ask if you want optional 
   transformation of the coordinates and conservative variables.

<ol><h4><li>Transformation to regular Cartesian grid</h4>
<pre>
Transform (regular/polar/none)? 'regular'
</pre>
   The above choice <b>regular</b> will interpolate the irregular grid onto a 
   regular one using the <b>triangulate</b> and <b>interpolate</b> functions.
   The size of the regular grid is asked now
<pre>
nxreg (eg. 100 or [50 60])? 100
Reading:x y rho m1 m2 e
Triangulate...
</pre>
   The coordinates and the conservative variables are read, and they
   are transformed onto a 100 x 100 Cartesian grid. The triangulation
   is a quite sophisticated algorithm to determine the nearest neghbours and 
   weights for the interpolation, and it may require a few seconds to complete.
   If the same grid is used later, the triangulation is not repeated, 
   only interpolation is done, which is a very fast and simple function. 
   The interpolated variables replace the originals, and they have size 
   <b>nxreg</b>.

<h4><li>Transformation to polargrid</h4>

   You may choose to do a polargrid transformation if the simulation
   was done on a general grid that represents a polar grid, and you want 
   to see the result in polar coordinates:
<pre>
Transform (regular/polar/none)? 'polar'
</pre>
   The vector variables are transformed to polar components. In 2D MHD, 
   for example, the momenta and the magnetic field components are the two
   vectors, thus:
<pre>
Radial and phi component(s) of vector variables among
wnames                           =rho m1 m2 e b1 b2
polar_r(s)   (eg. mr br     ...)? 'm1 b1'
polar_phi(s) (eg. mphi bphi ...)? 'm2 b2'
</pre>
   Now the coordinates and the conservative variables are read and transformed
   to polar coordinates and the vector variables to polar vector components.
</ol>
<H2><A NAME="Plotfunc">Plotting</A> the Data</H2>

   Once the data is read by <A HREF=#Getpict>getpict</A> or 
   <A HREF=#Animate>animate</A> you can plot functions of the conservative
   variables by
<pre>
plotfunc
</pre>
   You will see the name of the variables and asked for the functions to be
   plotted
<pre>
Variables= x y h m1 m2
func(s) (rho m1;m2 ...)        = 'h'
</pre>
   Functions that you can plot are any expression of the conserved variables,
   or function names which are defined in Matlab/get_func.m, namely
<pre>
v1, v2, v3, pth, T, csound, mach, divb, divb4, divb_rz, divb_rp, j, j_rz, j_rp,
A, A_r, AA, AA_r
</pre>
   meaning the velocity components, thermal pressure, temperature, sound speed,
   mach number, divergence B with a second or fourth order formula 
   in slab or cylindrical symmetry or polar coordinates,
   current in slab or cylindrical symmetry or polar coordinates, and
   vector potential in slab or cylindrical symmetry integrated from bottom
   or left, respectively. The contours of the vector potential are useful to
   draw magnetic field lines.
   You can easily add new function definitions in the 
   Matlab/<A HREF=#Get_func>get_func</A>.m script.

   More than one components of a function can be given by separating them
   with semicolons. The functions themselves are separated by spaces, e.g.
<pre>
func(s) (rho m1;m2 ...)       ? 'h m1./h;m2./h'
autorange(s) (1/0 or [1 0 1]) ? 1
plotmode(s)                   ? 'pcolor quiver'
</pre>
   will plot height and two components of the velocity. Some plotmodes can use
   three components, e.g. you can plot a colormap for height together with 
   the velociy field by typing
<pre>
func='h;m1./h;m2./h'
plotmode='pcolor_quiver'
plotfunc
</pre>
   You can choose a different plotmode for all the functions. If the number
   of plotmodes given is smaller than the number of functions <b>nfunc</b>,
   the last plotmode will be used for the rest of the functions.
   This padding rule is used for all the arrays entered.
   The choice of plotmodes is shown for the appropriate number of dimensions:
<pre>
1D plotmodes: plot/loglog/semilogx/semilogy

2D plotmodes for 1 variable : mesh/surf/surfc/surfl/contour/pcolor/pcolorc
             for 2 variables: quiver/pcolor_contour
             for 3 variables: contour_quiver/pcolor_quiver
</pre>
   The default 1D and 2D plotmodes are <b>plot</b> and <b>mesh</b>, 
   respectively. Note that <b>surfl</b> and any plotmode involving 
   <b>contour</b> lines can only be used for (interpolated) Cartesian grids, 
   but all the other plotmodes work for generalized coordinates without any 
   transformation needed.
<p>
   The <b>autorange</b> array determines whether the <b>fmin</b> and 
   <b>fmax</b> arrays are calculated from the data, or if they are given 
   by the user. As usual in Matlab, 1 means true, and 0 means false. Thus
<pre>
autorange(s) (1/0 or [1 0 1])  = 1
</pre>
   will calculate the function ranges for all functions automatically, while
<pre>
autorange=0
fmin=[0 -1]
fmax=[1 1]
</pre>
   sets the ranges 0 to 1 and -1 to 1 for two functions, respectively.   
<p>
   There are a few more plotting parameters which have reasonable default 
   values, but, of course, they can be modified:
<pre>
plottitle(s) (e.g. 'B [G];J')  = 'default' 
Shading(s) flat/faceted/interp = 'flat' 
Colorbar(s) (1/0 or [1 0 1])   = 0
View=[-37.5 30] Contourlevel=30 Contourstyle='g-' Quiverscale=1
multiplot=[] Bottomline=2 Headerline=2
</pre>
   The <b>plottitle</b> parameter is usually set to <b>default</b> which
   means that the function name is used for the title, but you can set it
   explicitly, e.g. <kbd>plottitle='Height;Velocity'</kbd>. Here the 
   separator character is a semicolon, thus the titles may contain spaces.
   No titles will be displayed if <kbd>plottitle=' '</kbd> is set.
   The meaning of the parameters <b>Shading, Colorbar</b>, and <b>View</b> 
   is rather obvious, the first two can be defined for each function 
   separately. The number of contour levels and the line style of contour lines
   are given by <b>Contourlevel</b> and <b>Contourstyle</b>, while 
   the length of the arrows is scaled with <b>Quiverscale</b>.
<p>
   The number of subplots is usually determined automatically from 
   <b>nfunc</b>, but you can override this by setting e.g.
   <b>multiplot=[2,3,0]</b>, which gives 2 by 3 subplots filled in row-wise.
   If the third element is 1, the subplots are filled in column-wise.
   <em>The number of subplots cannot be smaller than the number of functions!
   </em> Setting <b>multiplot=[]</b> gives the default behaviour.
   The variables <b>bottomline</b> and <b>headerline</b> control how many
   values are shown from <b>time, it, nx</b> at the bottom and from 
   <b>headline, nx</b> at the top, respectively.
<p>
   To cut out part of the computational domain, or to decrease the number of 
   points plotted (e.g. for quiver), you can define the <b>cut</b> string 
   to describe any valid Matlab array sections. E.g. in 1D
<pre>
cut='3:10'
cut='1:4:200'
</pre>
   or in 2D
<pre>
cut='1:2:nx1,1:2:nx2'
cut='3,:'
cut=':,2:10'
</pre>
   The effect on the function is simply the evaluation of 
   <kbd>f=f(</kbd><em>cut</em><kbd>)</kbd> in the
   <A HREF=#Get_func>get_func</A> script <em>after</em> any grid 
   transformation and <em>after</em> the functions are calculated so 
   that derivatives can be properly taken. 
   To plot the full domain again (which is the default) simply set
   <kbd>cut=''</kbd>.

<H2><A NAME="Plot more">Plotting</A> another Snapshot</H2>

   If you type
<pre>
getpict
plotfunc
</pre>
   again, the data will be read and plotted again without any questions asked,
   since MATLAB remembers the previous settings. This can be useful if the 
   data changed in the file due to running VAC or VACINI with new parameters, 
   for example.
<p>
   If you want to read another frame, say the second, from the same file, type
<pre>
npict=2
getpict
</pre>
   You can change the <b>func</b> and <b>plotmode</b> variables the same way:
<pre>
func='rho pth'
plotmode='contour'
plotfunc
</pre>
   Note that we did not need to reread the data.
   Other variables, all listed in <b>Matlab/defaults</b>, can be set similarly.
   If you set
<pre>
Doask=1
<p></pre>
   the macros will ask for all the parameters to be confirmed by a simple
   RETURN, or to be changed by typing a new value. Set <kbd>Doask=0</kbd> to
   get the default behaviour, which is no confirmation asked.
   You can return to the default settings for all parameters by running
<pre>
defaults
</pre>

<H2><A NAME="Animate">Plotting and Animation with animate and playmovie
</A></H2>
   This general procedure can plot, save into file(s), print, or animate 
   (using MATLAB's <kbd>movie</kbd>) different functions of data 
   read from one or more files. If a single snapshot is read the
   plot is drawn without animation. In essence <b>animate</b> combines
   <b>getpict</b> and <b>plotfunc</b> for any number of files and any number 
   of snapshots. The <b>Movie</b> variable created by <b>animate</b> can be 
   replayed afterwards by the <b>playmovie</b> script.
<pre>
animate
</pre>
   will first prompt you for <kbd>filename(s)</kbd> unless already given. 
   Animating more than one input files in parallel is
   most useful for comparing simulations with the same or very similar physics
   using different methods or grid resolution. It is a good idea to save 
   snapshots at the same <em>physical</em> time into the data files, so
   use <b>dtsave</b> and <b>tsave</b> or fixed time steps <b>dtpar</b> in the 
   parameter file for VAC. The headlines and the grid sizes will be shown in 
   the headerline for each file separately above the corresponding plots.
<p>
   The animation runs from the <b>firstpict(s)</b>th snapshot(s), 
   every <b>dpict(s)</b>th snapshots are plotted, and the total number of 
   snapshots read is at most <b>npictmax</b>.
   Both <b>firstpict</b> and <b>dpict</b> can be arrays with their elements
   corresponding to the files listed in the <b>filename</b> string.
   Since MATLAB needs a long time to save a movie, you can set 
   <b>doanimate=0</b>, in which case the plots are shown only once
   with a pause in between, and the <b>Movie</b> array is not filled up.
   You can also save the frames into a series of PostScript files 
   <b>Movie/matlab1.ps, matlab2.ps,...</b> by setting <b>dohardplot</b>, e.g.
<pre>
dohardplot=1
animate
...
Printfile (printer/FILENAME)  = 'Movie/matlab' 
Device (ps/psc/eps/epsc/gif8...) = 'ps' 
Orient (tall/landscape/portrait) = 'landscape' 
Execute: print -dps Movie/matlab0 ?
Hit RETURN to print, enter 0 to skip, -1 to quit:
...
</pre>
   Other options, like GIF files, or directing the output to a printer can
   be selected by setting the parameters <b>Printfile, Device</b> and 
   <b>Orient</b>. The choices are shown above.
   GIF files can be put together into a movie by some program like
   <b>mpeg_encode</b>, but that is not provided as part of VAC.
<p>
   The function(s) to be animated and the plotmode(s) for the functions 
   are determined by the same <b>func</b> and <b>plotmode</b> 
   strings as for <A HREF=#Plotfunc>plotfunc</A>. If any of the 
   <b>autorange(s)</b> is set to <b>1</b>,
   the data file(s) will be read twice: first for setting the common range(s) 
   for all the snapshots and the second time for plotting.
   If <b>autorange=0</b> for all the functions, the file is read only once,
   the function ranges has to correctly given by <b>fmin</b> and <b>fmax</b>.
<p>
   Besides changing the arrangements of subplots, as explained for 
   <A HREF=#Plotfunc>plotfunc</A>, the <b>multiplot</b> array can also be 
   used to produce <b>time series</b> with <b>animate</b>, i.e. 
   several snapshots can be put next to each other. For example
<pre>
filename='data/example22.out'
func='h'
plotmode='mesh'
npictmax=6
multiplot=[3,2,0]
Bottomline=1
animate
</pre>
   will show the first 6 snapshots of height in a single plot. 
   Now the time is shown for each plot individually, and setting
   <b>Bottomline=1</b> limits the time stamp to the most essential
   information, time. If <b>npict*nfile*nfunc</b> is greater than the number 
   of subplots defined by <b>multiplot</b>, an animation is done, or
   with <b>dohardplot=1</b>, several hardcopies can be produced,
   each containing a few snapshots, which is convenient for printing an 
   animation.
<pre>
multiplot=[]
</pre>
   will return to the default behavior, which is one snapshot per plot.

<H2><A NAME="Get_func">Function Definitions in get_func</A></H2>

   Any function of the conservative variables, the coordinates, and the 
   equation parameters can be defined in the <b>Matlab/get_func</b> file. 
   Extra information is provided by the equation type <b>physics</b> and the 
   number of vector components <b>ndir</b>. 
   The function is identified by the string <b>fun</b>. The user can easily 
   define new functions for a specific application by adding a new 
   <b>elseif</b> construct.

   For convenience a few frequently used functions are defined in a rather 
   general way, they work for all the appropriate equations and number of 
   dimensions as long as the standard variable names 
   <b>rho, m1, m2, m3, e, b1, b2, b3</b> are used, and <b>physics</b> is known.
   Currently the following functions are defined
<pre>
Function name	Variables used		Meaning
------------------------------------------------------------
v1		m1,rho			velocity in 1st direction
v2		m2,rho			velocity in 2nd direction
v3		m3,rho			velocity in 3rd direction
pth		rho,m1..,e,b1..,gamma	thermal pressure
T		rho,m1..,e,b1..,gamma	temperature
csound		rho,m1..,e,b1..,gamma	soundspeed
mach 		rho,m1..,e,b1..,gamma	mach number
j		b1,b2			current for slab symmetry
j_rz		b1,b2			current for cylindrical symmetry
j_rp		b1,b2			current for polar coordinates
divb		b1,b2			div B for slab symmetry
divb4		b1,b2			4th order div B for uniform Cartesian
divb_rz		b1,b2			div B for for cylindrical symmetry
divb_rp		b1,b2			div B for for polar coordinates
A               b1,b2                   Vector potential
AA              b1,b2                   Same as A but integrated rowwise
A_r             b1,b2                   Vector potential for cylindrical symm.
AA_r            b1,b2                   Same as A_r but integrated rowwise
</pre>
   Note that the derivatives are not accurate at the edges. The <b>cut</b>
   string can be used to cut off the outermost cells for plotting.

<H2><A NAME="Logfile">Reading the Logfile with getlog</A></H2>

   The logfile can be read by the <b>getlog</b> script, which reads data 
   from the file given by the <b>logfilename</b> parameter,
   and puts it into matrices named as in the 3rd line of the logfile, 
   which is (partially) defined by the <b>wnames</b> parameter in the 
   <b>methodlist</b> of the VAC parameter file. A simple example is 
<pre>
getlog
logfilename ? 'data/example22.log'
headline     =ExampleA
Reading the wlog matrix...
Number of rows in wlog: 20
Extracting columns of wlog into arrays:
 it   t   dt   h         m1      m2

plot(t,h)
xlabel('t')
ylabel('h_mean')
</pre>
which checks the global mass conservation for exampleA.
