<H2><A NAME="Centdiff">2nd Order Central Difference</A> Scheme: 
typefull='cd',...</H2>

<p><b>setvac -on=cd</b><p>

The explicit central differencing schemes are not stable by themselves for 
advection dominated problems. The second order central difference scheme
('cd') is used by the TVD scheme before the limiting is applied. 
Otherwise it is useful for testing a few time steps,
since this scheme contains no artificial fluxes, thus comparison with
analytic formulae is straightforward. In principle, it could be used
for stable implicit time differencing, but there are big oscillations.
It might also be used as an alternative predictor step for other schemes,
e.g. for the TVD scheme. 

<H2><A NAME="Filter">Filtered 4th Order Central Difference</A> Scheme: 
typefull='cd4',...</H2>

<p><b>setvac -on=cd,tvd,rk</b><p>

The fourth order central difference scheme ('cd4')
is implemented for uniform Cartesian grid with slab symmetry only.
It should be combined with a filter (e.g. typefilter='tvd1',...), which adds
a second order diffusive flux afterwards. The diffusion should be reduced
by the artificial compression method (ACM) using the 'acmcoef', 
'acmexpo', and 'acmwidth' parameters. The fourth order central difference
scheme should normally be combined with a fourth (or at least third) order
time integration scheme (e.g. typeadvance='fourstep'). 
Helen Yee found a significant improvement relative to 2nd order TVD schemes
for hydrodynamic problems that involve a combination of discontinuities and 
smooth flow.
For similar MHD problems, our preliminary tests (T&oacute;th and Yee) 
showed only a slight improvement 
relative to the second order schemes, while the computation time 
per time step is larger significantly. The reason of this modest 
success seems to be related to the numerically created div B problem.

<H2><A NAME="MacCormack">MacCormack</A> Scheme: typefull='mc',...</H2>

<p><b>setvac -on=mc</b><p>

The MacCormack method is implemented for problems with no shocks and no steep
gradients. It is very simple, and faster than the more complicated FCT and TVD
algorithms. 
<p>
This method has not been tested much, but it fails with the Brio-Wu shock tube,
and seems to work for the advection test of a semicircle wave.
It is mainly needed in the TVD-MacCormack scheme.

<H2><A NAME="FCT">FCT</A> Scheme: typefull='fct',...</H2>

<p><b>setvac -on=fct</b><p>

The FCT algorithms can handle discontinuities. Some spurious oscillation
can be produced in MHD calculations. Two types of FCT are implemented: 
ETBFCT (typefct='etbfct') the default, and YDFCT (typefct='ydfct'). 
<p>
ETBFCT should be run with Courant number below 0.5, typically set 
<b>courantpar=0.4</b>. 
<p>
In multidimensions it can be used both with the default dimensional splitting 
(<b>dimsplit=T</b>), and in a fully multidimensional way (<b>dimsplit=F</b>). 
No clear advantage of the latter method has been demonstrated so far, 
except for the Zalesak slotted cylinder problem. 
<p>
There is a great variety of limiters for the unsplit ETBFCT scheme, 
see Man/<A HREF="par.html#Methodlist">par</A>. It is not clear which one is best, but it does not make a 
big difference most probably.
<p>
In most cases YDFCT produces results very similar to ETBFCT, but it is 
twice as fast, since it works up to Courant number 1, typically set 
<b>courantpar=0.8</b>.
You have to use dimensional splitting with YDFCT to avoid numerical 
instability, thus there is no choice of limiters either. 
<p>
Both FCT methods use ETBFCT for predictor step.

<H2><A NAME="TVDLF">TVDLF</A> Scheme: typefull='tvdlf','tvdlf1'...</H2>

<p><b>setvac -on=tvdlf</b><p>

The TVD Lax-Friedrich method is robust, in most cases there are no spurious
oscillations, but it is somewhat more diffusive than FCT or the other TVD
methods. Since it does not use a Riemann solver, it is usually faster than 
either YDFCT or TVD. 
<p>
The Courant number should be less than 1, <b>courantpar=0.8</b> is recommended.
<p>
TVDLF should be dimensionally split according to Yee, <b>dimsplit=T</b>.
Numerical experiments show however that in most cases TVDLF can be used with 
<b>dimsplit=F</b>, and maybe with a slightly reduced Courant number 
(to around 0.5) as well. The unsplit evaluation is usually more efficient and 
more accurate for generalized coordinates, it is also preferred for steady
state calculations.
<p>
The second order TVDLF scheme <b>typefull='tvdlf'</b> uses limiters.
There are a few choices available: the 'minmod' limiter gives the smoothest 
result, the 'woodward' limiter is sharper, and the 'superbee' limiter is 
probably too sharp. The <b>'woodward'</b> limiter is recommended, but note
that the default is the most robust <b>typelimiter='minmod',...</b>.
The slope limiting is performed on the conservative variables by default.
Numerical problems (e.g. negative temperature) can often be avoided by
limiting the slopes of the primitive variables: set <b>useprimitive=T</b>
in the method list of the parameter file.
Second order time discretization is best achieved by a Hancock predictor step.
<p>
The first order TVDLF method <b>typefull='tvdlf1'</b> uses no limiters 
or predictor step as it is only first order accurate. It is mostly needed for
the implicit and semi-implicit schemes, since it uses a compact 3-point 
stencil, and it is inexpensive.

<H2><A NAME="TVDMUSCL">TVD</A>-MUSCL Scheme: typefull='tvdmu','tvdmu1',...</H2>

<p><b>setvac -on=tvdlf,tvd</b><p>

The TVD-MUSCL scheme is a two-step TVD algorithm using the same Hancock
predictor step and upwinding as TVDLF, and a characteristic based Riemann
solver similar to the TVD and TVD-MacCormack methods. 
At the moment Riemann solvers are implemented for adiabatic hydrodynamics 
(setvac -p=hdadiab), hydrodynamics (-p=hd), isothermal or polytropic MHD
(-p=mhdiso) and full MHD (-p=mhd). 
The scalar transport equation (-p=rho) has a trivial Riemann solver. 
Though the Riemann solver is computationally expensive, it is applied only 
once per time step in the predictor-corrector scheme, thus it is fairly 
efficient. Consequently the scheme has comparable resolution to the non-MUSCL
TVD method, but it is slightly slower due to the predictor step. It is, of 
course, considerably slower than the simple TVDLF algorithm.
<p>
The first order <b>typefull='tvdmu1'</b> scheme uses no limiters, it is 
a first order upwind scheme <em>for each characteristic variable</em>. 
It may be used for test purposes, or for a (semi-)implicit time integration.
<p>
The Courant number should be less than 1, <b>courantpar=0.8</b> is recommended.
<p>
TVD-MUSCL can be dimensionally split <b>dimsplit=T</b> or unsplit <b>F</b>.
If instabilities occured and the dimensional splitting is not desirable 
(e.g. for generalized coordinates or steady state calculation), 
the rather expensive multistep Runge-Kutta schemes can be applied, 
e.g. "typeadvance='sterck'", or the Courant number can be reduced to e.g. 0.5.
<p>
<b>typelimiter</b> has the same meaning as for TVDLF.
The slope limiting is performed on the conservative variables by default.
Numerical problems (e.g. negative temperature) can often be avoided by
limiting the slopes of the primitive variables setting <b>useprimitive=T</b>
in the method list of the parameter file.
<p>
Linear Riemann solvers can produce non-physical solutions. This might be
eliminated by the use of an entropy fix, but the default is 
<b>typeentropy='nul',...</b>, since this problem does not seem to occur 
too often. Tests of the different entropy fixes suggest that 
the <b>'powell'</b> entropy fix is the most effective when an entropy fix
is needed at all, while the <b>'yee'</b> fix requires the least calculations,
and the <b>'harten'</b> fix is the least diffusive.
<p>
In multidimensional MHD calculations the divergence of the magnetic field
can cause a numerical instability. There are three ways to stabilize it.
The default is <A HREF="#Powell's">Powell's</A> eight-wave Riemann solver
(divbwave=T) with non-conservative source terms (divbfix=T), which eliminates 
the instability, but not the error, in div B. If <b>div B</b> becomes 
significant relative to the current density <b>curl B</b>, the 
<A HREF="#Projection">projection scheme</A> (nproc=1,0,0,0) or one of the 
<A HREF="#Constrain">constrained transport/central difference</A>
schemes (dvibconstrain=T) should be used, which keep div B small.

<H2><A NAME="TVD">TVD</A> Scheme: typefull='tvd','tvd1',...</H2>

<p><b>setvac -on=tvd,cd</b><p>

The non-MUSCL TVD method with Roe's approximate Riemann solver is one of
the most accurate and efficient of the implemented schemes. 
<p>
There are a few variants of the TVD scheme, but the default 
<b>typetvd='roe'</b> is the fastest and no difference between the performance 
of the different types has been found, except for the 'symmetric' type, 
which is quite diffusive.
<p>
The solver has to be dimensionally split, set <b>dimsplit=T</b>.
<p>
The Courant number should be less than 1, <b>courantpar=0.8</b> is recommended.
<p>
The same limiters can be used as for TVDLF and TVD MUSCL, but they are 
applied to the characteristic waves, rather than to the conservative 
variables. The order of the characteristic waves is defined in the 
<b>vacpar.t.*</b> files. The <b>'woodward'</b> limiter is recommended, 
but note that the default is <b>typelimiter='minmod',...</b>. 
It may be beneficial to use the 'superbee' limiter
for the entropy wave to resolve contact discontinuities.
The 'roe' and 'superroe' limiters (by Arora and Roe JCP 132, p.3)
can also be used, they seem to be very similar to the 'woodward' and 
'superbee' limiters, respectively, but slightly more complicated.
For <b>typetvd='harten'</b>, artificial compression may also be applied
by setting the elements of the <b>artcomp</b> logical array to true. The
original TVD scheme by A.Harten uses artificial compression and minmod limiter,
but it seems that using the Woodward limiter is simpler and just as good.
<em>Artificial compression has been implemented in VAC by M.Nauta</em>.
<p>
The TVD scheme is a single step method, still sources are evaluated to second
order accuracy using D.Ryu's (APJ 452, p.377) preprocessing step (with
a slight correction by G. T&oacute;th). 
For steady state and/or implicit calculations, however, the 
<em>temporally first but spatially second order</em> <b>tvd1</b>
method is advised. This scheme was suggested by H.Yee: simply all terms
proportional to dt**2 are omitted from the TVD scheme.
<p>
The entropy fix for the Riemann solver is given by the <b>typeentropy</b>
array, it has the same meaning as for the TVD-MUSCL method, and for MHD,
the divergence B problem should also be taken care of.

<H2><A NAME="TVDMC">TVD-MacCormack</A> Scheme: typefull='tvdmc',...</H2>

<p><b>setvac -on=tvd,mc</b><p>

The TVD-MacCormack scheme is very similar to the TVD scheme, except that
it uses a second order MacCormack step instead of a single Euler step 
before the limiting is done. It is somewhat slower, and for the Brio-Wu
problem it seems to produce oscillations at the same place as the FCT methods.
<p>
Reducing the Courant parameter seems to help, thus
<b>courantpar=0.5</b> is recommended.
<p>
Due to its two-step nature it can evaluate source terms to second order 
accuracy, and does not require dimensional splitting. For these purposes,
however, the TVD-MUSCL scheme is probably superior, therefore it is 
recommended instead of TVD-MacCormack.
<p>
The remarks on the <b>typetvd</b>, <b>typelimiter</b>, and <b>typeentropy</b>
parameters and on the <b>div B</b> problem made for the TVD scheme also apply 
here.

<H2><A NAME="Divb">Maintaining</A> the div B=0 Condition</H2>

In multidimensional MHD the numerical conservation of div B is
not guaranteed by the standard FCT or TVD type schemes. 
This can lead to inaccuracies as well as instablilities.
There are three ways to deal with this problem with VAC.

<H4><A NAME="Powell's">Powell</A>'s fix: divbfix=T, divbwave=T</H4>

For multidimensional MHD calculations the non-conservative form of
the <A HREF=equations.html#MHD>MHD equations</A> seems to produce better 
results than the usual conservative form. The idea is to include
source terms proportional to div B into the momentum, energy and induction
equations and to add a divergence wave for the Riemann solver.
<p>
Powell's scheme is fast, it stabilizes the Riemann solver, improves results
for FCT and TVDLF, but it is non-conservative, and div B is not kept close to 
zero. A good alternative can be the projection scheme.

<H4><A NAME="Projection">Projection</A> scheme: divbfix=F, nproc=1,..</H4>

<p><b>setvac -on=poisson</b><p>

If you use the projection scheme, you can probably switch Powell's corrective 
sources off by <b>divbfix=F</b>, since the corrective source terms 
proportional to div B will be extremely small. You may also switch off the
divergence wave of the Riemann solver by <b>divbwave=F</b>. For implicit
time integration, however, leaving Powell's terms switched on is advised.
<p>
In multidimensional MHD calculations a projection scheme can be applied to
remove the divergence of the magnetic field by setting <b>nproc=1,0,0,0</b>
or <b>1,0,0,1</b> in the <b>&amp;methodlist</b>, which results in a call of 
the <b>projectb</b> subroutine in the <b>src/vacproc.projectb.t</b> file 
before every time step. 
See Man/<A HREF="par.html#nproc">par</A> for the detailed meaning of the 
<b>nproc</b> array.
<p>
The projection scheme corrects B to a divergence free B' by solving the
<pre>
div grad phi = - div B
</pre> 
Poisson equation for the scalar field <b>phi</b>, and then it calculates 
<pre>
B'= B + grad phi
</pre>. The Poisson equation is solved by the Conjugate Gradient ('cg') 
or the stabilized Bi-Conjugate Gradient ('bicgstab'), or possibly the 
MINRES ('minres') iterative methods according 
to the value of <A HREF="par.html#Methodlist"><b>typepoisson</b></A>.
The CG method uses one matrix vector multiplications 
(i.e. the application of the Laplace operator) per iteration,
while BiCGSTAB requires two. However, the CG method is likely to fail
if the Laplace operator is not a symmetric matrix, which is usually 
the case on general non-Cartesian grids and/or in non-slab symmetry.
These schemes are in the src/vacpoisson.t file, so the VACPOISSON
module has to be on (setvac -on=poisson). If only CG is used, the memory
usage can be reduced by setting nwrk=1 in src/vacdef.t 
(or in src/vacdef.f after precompilation), BiCGSTAB requires nwrk=5,
while MINRES requires temporary storage of nwrk=7 real numbers per grid point.
<p>
The <b>procpar</b> array determines how accurately the iterative scheme 
should solve the Poisson equation. In the first time step the maximum of
the magnitude of the divergence of the magnetic field 
<b>divbmax0=maxval(abs(div B))</b> is calculated 
(it is written to the terminal) and then the upper limit for abs(div B)
is set according to the values of <b>divbcoeff=procpar(1)</b> and 
<b>divbconst=procpar(2)</b>.
When both parameters are non-negative, the allowed maximum for div B is 
<pre>
divbmax = divbmax0*divbcoeff + divbconst  
</pre>
Using e.g. divbcoeff=0 results in divbmax=divbconst, while 
the default values are <b>divbcoeff=0.1</b> and <b>divbconst=0</b>,
which make divbmax one tenth of the initial value. A negative value
in the range <b>0&gt;divbcoeff&gt;-1</b> instructs the projection scheme to 
reduce the second norm of div B by a factor of |divbcoeff|. Finally, the 
maximum number of matrix vector multiplications <b>matvecmax</b> can be given 
by setting either divbcoeff or divbconst to a negative integer value. 
E.g. divbcoeff=-0.1 and divbconst=-100 requires the iterative scheme to 
reduce the second norm of div B by a factor of 0.1, but it also limits the 
number of iterations to be at most 100. Alternatively, divbcoeff=-100 and 
divbconst=0.01 requires max(abs(div B))<0.01 with matvecmax=100.
The default limit is rather huge, matvecmax=1000.
<p>
The third element of the <b>procpar</b> array is <b>divbbound</b>. 
Its absolute value determines whether total energy (=1), thermal pressure 
(=2), or total pressure (=3) should be conserved during the correction.
The sign of <b>divbbound</b> tells, if boundaries should be updated.
When it is positive the boundaries are updated after the projection scheme,
which may produce small errors in div B at the boundary.
The default value is -1, which means conservation of total energy, strict 
enforcement of div B, but less strict enforcement of the boundary conditions. 
<p>
Currently the projection scheme can handle cont, fixed, symmetric, and 
periodic boundary conditions exactly. These are recognized from the 
boundary type <b>typeB</b> being <b>cont, fixed, fixed1, symm, asymm</b>, 
or <b>periodic</b> for the orthogonal component of <b>B</b>. 
Even for these boundary types only <b>divbbound&gt;0</b> results in perfectly 
periodic or symmetric boundary conditions, but now div B remains small 
next to the boundaries, since the projection scheme takes the boundary 
conditions into account when the correction <b>phi</b> is calculated.
<p>
As an example, the meaning of <b>procpar=-15,0.01,2</b> is that abs(div B)
should be kept below 0.01 at the cost of at most 15 matrix vector 
multiplications; the correction of B should not change the thermal pressure;
and the boundary conditions should be applied after the correction.
<p>
The best way to estimate the allowable value for div B is to run the code for
a few time steps with <b>teststr='projectb'</b> set. A good strategy is to 
keep div B somewhat below the error produced in each time step. This way, the
error cannot grow and the number of iterations to achieve this accuracy
will be small, typically 10. 
<p>
With optimal settings the projection scheme should not use more than 5-30% 
of the total CPU time. The scheme is most efficient for slab symmetric 
Cartesian grids where both the Laplace operator and the iterative scheme (CG)
are the least expensive computationally.

<H4><A NAME="Constrain">CT/CD</A> schemes: divbfix=F, divbconstrain=T</H4>

<p><b>setvac -on=ct</b><p>

The constrained transport / central difference schemes (CT/CD) can 
maintain zero divergence (in some particular discretization) for the 
magnetic field to the accuracy of round-off errors as long as the initial and 
boundary condition are compatible with the constraint. Similarly to the 
projection scheme, the CT/CD step is applied after the <em>base scheme</b>,
(any second order scheme implemented in VAC) and it only affects the magnetic
field. Unlike the projection scheme, the CT/CD schemes are local operations
(no Poisson solver is needed), and they maintain
<pre>
         n+1        n
    div B    = div B
</pre>
in some particular discretization rather than eliminating the error. 
Therefore the initial and boundary conditions should satisfy div B=0 exactly. 
<p>
In their original form, the <b>CT</b> schemes use a staggered discretization 
for the magnetic field components, e.g. the b_x components are on the j-1/2,k
and j+1/2,k cell interfaces, while the b_y components are on the j,k-1/2
and j,k+1/2 interfaces. The staggered variables are updated by central
differencing the <em>cell edge</em> centered electric field 
<b>Omega=E_z</b>, consequently the divergence of the staggered field
<pre>

          x        x        y       y
         b       -b        b      -b
          j+1/2k  j-1/2k    jk+1/2  jk-1/2
div b  = --------------- + ---------------
     jk        dx                dy
</pre>
is kept zero. After the update, the staggered components are interpolated 
into the cell centered components.
<p>
<center><IMG SRC=method.stagger.gif></center>
<p>
In the VAC implementation, the staggered representation is never realized, 
the update is done directly on the cell centered variables. 
Still, the div B=0 constraint is satisfied,
but in a slightly unusual cell corner centered discretization:
<pre>
                   x       x     x     x     y       y     y     y
                  B      +B    -B    -B     B      +B    -B    -B
                   j+1k+1  j+1k  jk+1  jk    j+1k+1  jk+1  j+1k  jk   
div B          = ------------------------ + -----------------------
     j+1/2k+1/2               2 dx                    2 dy

</pre>
which can be plot by the <A HREF=idl.html#Animfunc>IDL macros</A> as 
'func=divb_CT'. 
<p>
The <b>central difference</b> approach does not assume intermediate 
staggered variables at all. The magnetic field is updated by central 
differencing the cell centered and time centered electric field:
<p>
<center><IMG SRC=method.center.gif></center>
<p>
Consequently the CD schemes maintaine div B=0 in the usual cell centered 
discretization
<pre>
          x     x       y     y
         B    -B       B    -B
          j+1k  j-1k    jk+1  jk-1
div B  = ----------- + -----------
     jk     2 dx         2 dy
</pre>
Both the constrained transport and central difference schemes update the
magnetic field by applying simple differences of the time centered 
<em>electric field</em>. The electric field is either approximated from
<b>v x B</b> at time levels <b>n</b> and <b>n+1</b>, or by collecting the
upwind fluxes of the TVD type schemes. These possibilities lead to at
least four different schemes: <b>field-CD, flux-CD, field-CT, flux-CT</b>.
There are further variations on how the spatial interpolation and the
construction of the (upwinded) electric field is combined.
The method is selected by the <A HREF=par.html#Methodlist>typeconstrain</A> 
parameter. 
<p>
Based on extensive numerical testing, the simplest field-CD scheme 
(<b>typeconstrain='EfieldCD'</b>) seems
to be the best, it performs similarly to the projection scheme. 
In some problems the flux-CT ('fluxCT') scheme is the best among the CT/CD
schemes. The field-CT and transport-flux-CT schemes are counteradvised.
The detailed comparison of these schemes with the projection scheme 
and Powell's 8-wave scheme is beyond the scope of this manual,
it is presented in the paper 
<A HREF=http://hermes.elte.hu/~gtoth/Papers/vac.html#Divb>
The div B=0 Constraint in Numerical MHD</A> in detail.
<p>
The CT and CD schemes can be generalized to 3D, to curvilinear grids, 
to axial symmetry, and/or to resistive MHD. 
Currently the field-CD scheme generalizations are implemented
in VAC.
