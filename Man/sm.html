<h1>SM VISUALIZATION MACROS</h1>

This document briefly describes the use of SM (informally known as 
Super Mongo) for plotting results from VAC. SM is not a free software,
contact Robert Lupton at <b>rhl@astro.princeton.edu</b> if you want to 
buy a copy.

This page describes how SM can be run by local users, and how the macros work. 
SM can only read the ASCII data files of VAC. You can use
<A HREF="convert.html#Convertdata">convertdata</A> 
to convert binary files to ASCII.

<H2><A NAME="Initialization">Initialization</A> File for SM</h2>

   SM needs a .sm file in your main directory, create this file
   based on the <b>.sm</b> file in the main vac/ directory, or a file
   used by other users of SM at your institute. The 
   <b>Sm/My.general.macros</b> file contains macros used by the other macros,
   it should be loaded into SM.

<H2><A NAME="Running">Running</A> SM</h2>

   To run SM simply type <b>sm</b>. To exit SM type <b>end</b>.
   On any macro or variable you may get information by <b>help NAME</b>.

<H2><A NAME="Plotting">Plotting</A> results</h2>

There are two basic macros to plot snapshots, <b>ini</b> and <b>out</b>.
They do the same except that <b>ini</b> reads the initial file defined by
the <b>$Inifile</b> variable, while <b>out</b> uses <b>$Outfile</b>.
They have three optional arguments, <b>npict</b>, <b>ixy</b>, and a list
of variable names and/or expressions.

<H2><A NAME="1D">Snapshots</A> in 1D </h2>
<p>
   To plot results of e.g. the second saved snaphot in <b>data/PROBLEM.out</b>
<pre>
use PROBLEM
out 2
</pre>
   The <b>use</b> macro sets the variables <b>$Inifile</b>, <b>$Outfile</b> and <b>$Logfile</b>
   to <b>data/PROBLEM.ini</b>, <b>data/PROBLEM.out</b> and <b>data/PROBLEM.log</b>, 
   respectively. The <b>out</b> macro plots the variables of the given snapshot
   read from the <b>$Outfile</b>.
<p>
   In 1D you may choose to see points or continuous lines by the macros
   <b>pointson</b>, <b>pointsoff</b>, <b>lineon</b>, and <b>lineoff</b>. Say <b>help ptype</b>,
   <b>help ltype</b>, <b>help lweight</b> and <b>help ctype</b> for more options.
<p>
<H2><A NAME="2D">Snapshots</A> in 2D</h2>

   In 2D the second parameter of <b>out</b> determines where the image should 
   be cut for a 1D plot. If <b>ixy&gt;0</b> the cut is parallel to the 
   <b>x</b> axis with <b>iy=ixy</b> kept constant. The default value is 
   <b>ixy=1</b> which makes sense for 1D results as well. It is also the 
   fastest to extract from the multi-D data file. 
   If <b>ixy&lt;0</b> the cut is along the <b>y</b> axis with 
   <b>ix=abs(ixy)</b> fixed. Thus
<pre>
out 2 10
out 2 -10
</pre>
   will cut the 2D results at <b>iy=10</b> and <b>ix=10</b>, respectively.
<p>
   Finally <b>ixy=0</b> produces a 2D plot, which depends on <b>$Plotmode</b>.
   The default <b>Plotmode</b> is <b>Surface</b>. Other possibilities are <b>Contour</b>,
   <b>Greyscale</b> or <b>Colormap</b>.
<pre>
out 1 0
</pre>
   will result in surface plots of each conserved variable of the first 
   snapshot with the default settings. See below how to plot other variables.
   The <b>plotsurface</b> macro prompts you for the distance between gridlines
   actually drawn. You typically want no more than 100 lines in one 
   direction. Try <b>define Dix 1 define Diy 1</b> for maximum resolution.
   Say <b>help viewpoint</b> for control on viewing angle and distance.
<pre>
define Plotmode Contour
</pre>
   makes <b>out</b> produce contour plots, <b>Colormap</b> and 
   <b>Greyscale</b> are also available. A parameter may be added to set 
   the number of levels
<pre>
define Plotmode "Colormap 30"
</pre>
   Say <b>help Colormap</b> and <b>help Greyscale</b> for more options. The 
   default <b>$Plotmode</b> is <b>Surface</b> which uses <b>surfaceplot</b>.
<p>
   Once a 2D file is read you may refer to the last snapshot by number 0:
<pre>
out 0 0
</pre>

<H2><A NAME="Manipulation">Manipulation</A> of Variables</h2>

   You have control over the plotted variables as well:
<pre>
out 3 1 rho m1/rho
</pre>
   will plot the density and the first component of the velocity at
   the <b>y=1</b> cut of the 3rd snapshot. You can list as many expressions
   as you wish. Some variables are calculated automatically if the
   <b>extravar</b> macro is present. For MHD results load <b>Sm/mhd</b> by
<pre>
inic mhd
</pre>
   Say <b>help extravar</b> to see which variables will be derived by 
   <b>out</b>.
   You may create your own <b>extravar</b> macro in a similar manner. The 2D
   variables are referenced by <b>Avarname</b>, thus
<pre>
out 0 0 sqrt(Ab1**2+Ab2**2)
</pre>
   will plot the magnitude of the magnetic field. You can create 
   vectorfield plots by placing a <b>^</b> between to array variables
<pre>
out 0 0 Ab1^Ab2
</pre>
   will plot vectors descibing the magnetic field. The size of the arrows
   can be changed by 
<pre>
define Plotmode2 "Vectorfield 4"
</pre>
   The <b>extraarr</b> macro, if present, can automatically calculate extra 
   arrays from the original conservative variables read from the file. Type 
   <b>help extraarr</b> to see what is available. You may have to 
<pre>
define Vectorpot 1
</pre>
   to make <b>extraarr</b> calculate the <b>Aa</b> vector potential for you.

<H2><A NAME="Overplotting">Overplotting</A> and Plotting Limits</h2>

   You can overplot previous plots in different colors by setting 
<pre>
eraseoff
green
</pre>
   The opposite effect is achieved by <b>eraseon</b>.
   It may be useful to use the same limits for the plots being compared.
<pre>
fixx XMIN XMAX
</pre>
   will fix the horizontal limits to run from XMIN to XMAX. For a single
   plot you may use 
<pre>
fixy 0 1
</pre>
   to set the vertical limits. To fix the limits of the last plot, and
   to simultaniously switch the <b>eraseoff</b> say
<pre>
fix
</pre>
   The limits can be made flexible and erase switched to <b>eraseon</b> by
<pre>
let
</pre>
   With multiple plots the different variables have different verticle
   limits in general, thus <b>fixy</b> is not very useful. But
<pre>
fixall
</pre>
   will fix the verticle limits for each variable to those of the last plot
   and also sets <b>eraseoff</b>.
<pre>
letall
</pre>
   has the opposite effect. The index ranges can also be fixed and let by
<pre>
fixind 1 99 1 99
letind
</pre>

<H2><A NAME="Evolution">Plotting</A> the Time Evolution</h2>

   Viewing the time evolution of some quantity stored in 
   <b>data/PROBLEM.log</b> is possible by typing e.g.
<pre>
plott rho
</pre>
   where we plot the average density <b>rho</b> as a function of time.
   The <b>pointson</b>, <b>pointsoff</b>, <b>lineon</b>, <b>lineoff</b>, 
   <b>eraseon</b>, <b>eraseoff</b>,
   <b>fixx</b>, <b>fixy</b>, <b>fix</b>, <b>let</b>, <b>fixall</b>, and 
   <b>letall</b> macros, also the
   <b>ptype</b>, <b>ctype</b>, <b>ltype</b> and <b>lweight</b> 
   commands have the same effect
   as in the 1D plots produced by <b>out</b>.
<p>
<H2><A NAME="Printing">Printing</A> the Plots</h2>

   Printing the result of a macro call can be done by inserting one
   of the printing macros at the beginning of the line:
<pre>
land MACRO PARAMETERS
</pre>
   will produce a landscape printout on te default <b>$printer</b> set in
   the file <b>.sm</b>. Also availabe are <b>port</b> and <b>square</b> for 
   portrait and square formats respectively. To print the result of a 
   series of commands 
<pre>
device postport
COMMAND
COMMAND
...
x
</pre>
   where the last macro <b>x</b> sets the device back to the terminal,
   and starts printing. To create an encapsulated PostScript file, type
<pre>
device postencap FILENAME.ps
COMMANDS
...
x
</pre>
