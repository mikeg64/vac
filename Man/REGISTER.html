Although VAC is distributed for no charge, there is a considerable amount
of work behind its development. For this reason, at least one of the
developers of the code expect to be co-author in the first publication 
which uses VAC in a substantial way, and to be referenced and acknowledged 
in later publications as the author of the original software. 
On the other hand we provide assistance for the user in 
the initial set up, and later if problems arise. The user will be notified 
about any major improvement or addition to the code. If you are interested
in applying the software to scientific problems being studied at the 
Astronomical Institute at Utrecht or at the FOM Institute at Nieuwegein,
then we expect that providing the software will lead to collaboration.
