<h1>EXAMPLE SIMULATIONS</h1>
<p>
This document describes a few relatively simple example simulations which
can be done based on the <b>src/vacusr.t.example, src/vacusrpar.t.example,
inipar/example*</b>, and <b>par/example*</b> files, which are part of the 
distributed VAC package. For sake of brevity in the examples it is assumed 
that you use IDL for visualization and that you can run the code on the local 
machine.
See Man/<A HREF="USAGE.html">USAGE</A> for a more complete description.
If you can, you should use the VAC User Interface <A HREF="Weblink.html">
Weblink</A>, it should not be difficult to follow the description below,
which is written for doing the examples from the UNIX shell.
The results of the example simulations can be found on the 
<A HREF=http://www.phys.uu.nl/~toth/>VAC Home Page</A> under the 
<A HREF=http://www.phys.uu.nl/~toth/VACMovie/movies.html>MOVIES</A> link.

<H2><A NAME="Configuration">Configuration</A> and Compilation</h2>

   Configure VACINI and VAC to the 2D 
   <A HREF="equations.html#HDADIAB">adiabatic hydrodynamics equations</A> 
   and use the example VACUSR module by typing:
<pre>
cd src
setvac -d=22 -phi=0 -z=0 -g=104,104 -p=hdadiab -u=example -on=cd,tvd -s
</pre>
   All other modules can be off.
   Actually this is the configuration set right after installation of the
   VAC package. You may check the current configuration by
<pre>
setvac -s
</pre>
   Edit the <b>Makefile</b> and select the options specific to your 
   computer and compiler if you have not done it yet. Set the compiler flags.
   Now make the executable codes
<pre>
make vacini
make vac
</pre>
   If everything went well you may return to the main VAC directory and change
   the names of the executables to express their configurations:
<pre>
cd ..
mv vacini vacini_example
mv vac vac_example
</pre>
   
<H2><A NAME="ExampleA">Example</A> A: circular waves in a pool</h2>

   This example shows circular surface waves produced by an initial height 
   perturbation in the middle of a square shaped pool which has reflective 
   walls. The shallow water equations are solved.
<p>
   To produce the <b>data/exampleA.ini</b> file containing the initial conditions type
<pre>
vacini_example &lt; inipar/exampleA22
</pre>
   Here is the parameter file
<pre>
data/exampleA22.ini

save
</pre>
   As you can see the first variable is height <b>h</b> and not the usual
   density <b>rho</b>. A 50 by 50 grid is set up covering the [0,1]x[0,1]
   domain. First a uniform height and zero velocity is set, then <b>h</b> is 
   set in the central 4 cells to a 1.3 amplitude.
   The equation parameters are set for the shallow water equations (gamma=2)
   with a vertical gravitational acceleration (g=2) and no Coriolis forces
   (coriolis=0). The Coriolis forces are defined in the example  
   <A HREF="vacusr.html#Specialsource">VACUSR module</A>.
<p>
   You may do the simulation by typing
<pre>
vac_example &lt; par/exampleA22 &amp;
</pre>
   The parameter file for VAC is the following:
<pre>
 &amp;testlist &amp;end

 &amp;filelist
        filenameini='data/exampleA22.ini',
        typefileini='ascii'
        filename=   'data/example22.log',
                    'data/example22.out'
        typefileout='binary'
 &amp;end

 &amp;savelist
        itsave(1,2)=0
        ditsave=5,5
 &amp;end

 &amp;stoplist
        itmax=100
 &amp;end

 &amp;methodlist
        wnames=         'h       m1      m2'
        typefull=       3*'tvd'
        typelimiter=    3*'woodward'
        dimsplit=       T
	sourcesplit=	F
        sourceunsplit=  F
 &amp;end

 &amp;boundlist
        typeB=  'symm','asymm','symm'
                'symm','asymm','symm'
                'symm','symm','asymm'
                'symm','symm','asymm'
 &amp;end

 &amp;paramlist
        courantpar=0.8
 &amp;end
</pre>
   It uses <b>data/exampleA22.ini</b> as input, and <b>data/example22.log</b> 
   and <b>data/example22.out</b> for output. The output files are the same in
   all examples to save disk space, but in general they should be different. 
   It is not really necessary to set <b>typefileini</b>, since VAC can
   recognize the input file format automatically.
   Change the <b>typefileout</b> parameter to <b>ascii</b> format if you 
   cannot visualize unformatted output.
<p>
   The simulation is run for 100 time steps. Every fifth snapshot is saved 
   together with logfile information (ditsave=5,5) and the initial data 
   as well (itsave(1,2)=0). The TVD method is used with the Woodward limiter.
   Dimensional splitting is required for the TVD method. There are no sources
   now (neither split nor unsplit), since eqpar(coriolis_)=0 was set in the 
   initial condition. The 
   boundaries are reflective, this means that at the first and second boundary 
   regions (left and right) the first component of the momentum <b>m1</b> is 
   anti-symmetric, while at the bottom and top regions <b>m2</b> is 
   anti-symmetric. The 'symm' boundary types are identical with 'symm0'
   (which is the general choice for reflective boundaries) for this simple 
   grid.
   Finally the Courant number is 0.8 which is appropriate for the TVD method.
<p>
   The results can be nicely <A HREF="idl.html">visualized by IDL</A> 
   once you see 
<pre>
 Finish Advance    18.340 sec
 Finished VAC      18.350 sec
</pre>
   on the screen. The actual CPU times depend on the machine, of course. 
   If the CPU times are zero, you need to correct <b>function cputime</b> 
   in <b>src/vac.t</b> and recompile VAC. 
<p>
   Start up IDL (read about the IDL_STARTUP environment variable in
   Man/<A HREF="idl.html">idl</A> first) by typing
<pre>
idl
</pre>
and do an animation of the height by typing the following
<pre>
.r animate
filename(s) ? data/example22.out
...
func(s) (e.g. rho p m1;m2 r*m1 -T) ? h
...
plotmode(s)                ? shade
</pre>
I hope you enjoyed the <em>movie</em>.

<H2><A NAME="ExampleAmpi">Example</A> A: MPI parallel version</h2>

   The previous example can also be done with MPI parallelization.
   See <A HREF="mpi.html">mpi.html</A> for complete information on MPI.
   Here a brief overview is presented.

   First edit the <b>src/Makefile</b> so that it compiles the code
   with <b>mpif90</b> and/or <b>mpif77</b> (or links the MPI library).
   Configure with
<pre>
setvac -on=mpi
</pre>
   and recompile the codes
<pre>
make vacini
make vac
</pre>
   Copy or link the <b>inipar/exampleAmpi22</b> and <b>par/exampleA22mpi</b>
   files to <b>vacini.par</b> and <b>vac.par</b>, respectively
<pre>
ln -s inipar/exampleAmpi22 vacini.par
ln -s par/exampleAmpi22 vac.par
</pre>
   In the VAC user interface simply select these parameter files and
   the links are automatically created before running the MPI versions 
   of the executables. These parameter files differ from the non-MPI versions
   in the name of the input data file only: <b>exampleA22.ini</b> is
   replaced with <b>exampleA22_np0201.ini</b>. The <b>_np0201</b> 
   indicates that the data is distributed on a 2 by 1 processor map,
   i.e. the computational domain is decomposed to 2 processors in the first 
   dimension and 1 processor in the second dimension. 
   The code should be run on 2 processors
<pre>
mpirun -np 2 vacini
mpirun -np 2 vac
</pre>
   If the run is executed on 2 CPU-s, the execution time will
   be less than on a single PE. 
   The resulting input and output files can be merged into a 
   single file (e.g. for visualization):
<pre>
Fix/distribution data/example22_np0201.out data/example22.out
</pre>

<H2><A NAME="ExampleB">Example</A> B: round blob</h2>

   This example is very similar to <b>Example A</b>, except that the boundaries
   are <b>continuous</b>, typeB='cont' in par/exampleB22, and that the initial 
   height perturbation is a <b>circular blob</b>. The latter effect is achieved
   by calling the <A HREF="vacusr.html#Specialini">specialini</A> subroutine 
   of the example VACUSR module in the <b>inipar/exampleB22</b> file by the 
   <b>special</b> action instead of <b>perturbvar</b>. Type
<pre>
vacini_example &lt; inipar/exampleB22
vac_example &lt; par/exampleB22 &amp;
</pre>
   to run the simulation. As the visualization in IDL
<pre>
.r animate
</pre>
   shows, the wave is very smooth and circular due to the nice initial data
   and there is very little reflection from the boundaries. You can try
<pre>
npict=5
.r getpict
contour,w(*,*,0)
</pre>
to check the roundness of the waves.

<H2><A NAME="ExampleC">Example</A> C: waves and Coriolis forces</h2>

This example demonstrates driving plane waves by a time-dependent boundary 
specified in the <A HREF="vacusr.html#Specialbound">specialbound</A> subroutine
in the example VACUSR module. 
The subroutine is called from the <b>par/exampleC22</b> parameter file with
<pre>
 &amp;boundlist
        typeB=  'special','special','fixed'
                'cont','cont','cont'
                'symm','symm','asymm'
                'symm','symm','asymm'
 &amp;end
</pre>
The <b>'special'</b> boundary type is set for the left boundary for the
height <b>h</b> and the first component of momentum <b>m1</b>, while the
transverse momentum is fixed to its original 0 value. The right boundary is
continuous, the top and bottom boundaries are reflective. 
<p>
To make things more interesting the <A HREF="vacusr.html#Specialsource">
Coriolis force</A> is switched on in the
<A HREF="par.html#Methodlist">&amp;methodlist</A> by setting 
<b>eqpar(coriolis_)=eqpar(3)</b> different from 0.
As a reminder the <b>fileheadout</b> header line is also set:
<pre>
 &amp;methodlist
        wnames=         'h       m1      m2'
        fileheadout=    'Example with Coriolis forces'
        eqpar(3)=       4.0
        typefull=       3*'tvdlf'
        typelimiter=    3*'woodward'
        dimsplit=       T
        sourcesplit=    T
 &amp;end
</pre>
Note that <b>sourcesplit=T</b> is required for this particular 
<b>specialsource</b> subroutine. We could have set both <b>eqpar</b> and the 
<b>filehead</b> in the <b>inipar/exampleC22</b>, but it is easier to play 
with the equation parameter without the need of running VACINI. 
<p>
The effect of the Coriolis force is to create transverse motion in the waves.
We use the <A HREF="vacusr.html#Specialio">savefilelog_special</A> subroutine 
in the VACUSR module to save the potential enstrophy and the average absolute 
transverse momentum into the logfile. The subroutine is called because of the 
<b>typefilelog='special'</b> setting in the <b>filelist</b>.
<p>
Do the simulation by typing
<pre>
vacini_example &lt; inipar/exampleC22
vac_example &lt; par/exampleC22 &amp;
</pre>
and visualize e.g. the height and the transverse velocity component:
<pre>
func='h vy'
.r animate
</pre>
The bumps on the plane waves appear due to the transverse motions created by
the Coriolis force, and reflected by the top and bottom boundaries.
A more detailed temporal information can be gained by inspecting the
<b>data/example22.log</b> file which shows an initial increase of the 
transverse momentum followed by a saturated oscillation
<pre>
.r getlog
logfilename(s) =data/example22.log ?
headline       =ExampleC_hdadiab22
Reading arrays step,t,dt,wlog:
  wlog(*, 0)= enstrophy
  wlog(*, 1)= abs_m2
Number of recorded timesteps: nt=      20
plot,t,wlog(*,1),xtitle='t',ytitle='|rho*vy|'
</pre>
You can make the movie more spectacular by overplotting the height and the
velocity field:
<pre>
func='h vx;vy'
plottitle='h and V'
plotmode='contfill vel'
multiplot=1
.r animate
multiplot=0
</pre>
The last command returns to the normal plotting behaviour.

<H2><A NAME="ExampleD">Example</A> D: Kelvin-Helmholtz instability</h2>

<em>M. Nauta is acknowledged here for the specifications of this test problem.
</em><p>
In this example the adiabatic hydrodynamical equations are solved.
The density, and thus the pressure, are uniform initially, while the
velocity field is a shear flow with a steep <b>y</b> gradient in the velocity
component <b>vx</b> in the middle band and a small sine wave perturbation in 
the normal velocity component <b>vy</b>. Due to the Kelvin-Helmholtz 
instability the perturbation is expected to increase exponentially in time.
<p>
The initial conditions are set up by using the predefined <b>shocktube</b> and
<b>perturbvar</b> actions in the <b>inipar/exampleD22</b> parameter file:
<pre>
data/exampleD22.ini
Kelvin-Helmholtz-instability_hdadiab22

100,100				- ixmax,iymax

1.	+0.5 	0.		-state of end of segment 1

1.	-0.5	0.		-state of end of segment 2
52				-position of segment-end 2
1.	-0.5	0.		-state of right boundary
2.	7.5	0.		-gamma, adiabatic coeff., Coriolis coeff.

18.8496	0.	0.	1.571		-k1=2*pi/lambda,k2,phase1,phase2
save
</pre>
Note that the grid  cells are rectangular with an aspect ratio 2 to 1, 
because the [0, 1]x[0, 0.5] domain is resolved by 100x100 grid cells.
The shear velocity <b>vx=m1</b> (the density is 1) drops from 0.5 to -0.5
from the 48-th to the 52-th cell with linear interpolation in between.
The adiabatic index gamma could be different from 2 here. The perturbation 
has a wavenumber k1=6*pi, thus there are 3 waves between the periodic 
left and right boundaries. The bottom and top boundaries are fixed
as it can be seen in the <b>par/exampleD22</b> file:
<pre>
 &amp;boundlist
	typeB=	3*'periodic'
		3*'periodic'
		3*'fixed'
		3*'fixed'
 &amp;end
</pre>
Like in <em>exampleC</em>, the 
<A HREF="vacusr.html#Specialio">savefilelog_special</A> subroutine
is used for producing the logfile <b>data/example22.log</b> since
<b>typefilelog='special'</b> is set in the parameter file. This allows
us to check the growth of the perturbation measured as the volume average
of |rho*v2|. 
<p>
Run the simulation by typing
<pre>
vacini_example &lt; inipar/exampleD22
vac_example &lt; par/exampleD22 &amp;
</pre>
This simulation takes longer than the other ones due to the higher grid
resolution and the number of time steps. But this is real physics!
To get a feeling of the flow, try
<pre>
func    ='rho vx;vy'
plottitle='rho and V'
plotmode='contfill vel'
multiplot=1
.r animate
multiplot=0
</pre>
Visualize e.g. the curl of the velocity field, the <b>curlv</b> function 
is already defined in <b>Idl/animfunc.pro</b>:
<pre>
func    ='curlv'
plotmode='contour'
contourlevel=15
.r animate
</pre>
The fast initial growth saturates when the perturbation becomes non-linear.
To see this, let us plot the last column <b>abs_m2</b> in the logfile on a 
semi-logarithmic plot:
<pre>
.r getlog
plot_io,t,wlog(*,1),xtitle='t',ytitle='|rho*vy|'
</pre>
A weak initial transient and then a nearly perfect exponential growth 
can be seen. The growth saturates by the end of the simulation.
