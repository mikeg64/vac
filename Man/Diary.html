				compilation no intermediate Fortran 90 files.
				Default Fortran compiler can be defined for 
				"make vac" and "make vacini".
		src/Makefile	"make vachpf" and "make vacinihpf" for HPF,
				"make vac90" and "make vacini90" for F90 
				compilation if it is not the default. These and
				"make vac77" and "make vacini77" will all

		Man/par		"typeadvance='extra'" for 3-level 2nd order 
				explicit extrapolation scheme, C<0.5 only.
09/04/97	Idl/getlog	Now can read from 1, 2, or 3 logfiles.
				The array "step" is read instead of "it" so
				no interference with "it" from data files.

10/04/97	Man/Idl		multiplot=N can be used instead of [N,1,1]
11/04/97	src/vacpp.pl	-O option to optimize for !SHIFT directives.
