<h1>PARAMETER FILES FOR VACINI</h1>

This document describes how the <b>inipar/PROBLEM</b> parameter files for 
VACINI should be used. Some features of no general interest remain 
partially documented, their use can be learned by reading the appropriate
subroutines in <b>src/vacini.t</b>.

<H2><A NAME="Header">Filename</A> and Header</h2>

The parameter file always starts with the following 3 lines:

<ol><li>the name of the initial file to be created, e.g.<br>
   <kbd>data/brio12.ini</kbd>
<li>the header line containing <b>_physics</b> that will appear in the 
first line of the initial file, e.g.<br>
   <kbd>Brio-Wu_mhd12</kbd>
<li>the names of the <b>x</b> and <b>w</b> variables, e.g.<br>
   <kbd>x rho m1 m2 e b1 b2</kbd>
</ol><p>
VACINI will automatically check physics, and it if is missing, VACINI
will put it in the header line. Do not use any other underscore '_' 
in the header line. You may use <b>Fix/iniparfix inipar/*</b> to replace
extra underscores by hyphens.
The equation parameter names are appended automatically to the third line. 
VAC will also check for physics in the headline and for the
equation parameter names among the variable names, and add them  
for the output file if they are missing. Still, it is a good idea to use this 
information in the inipar files, so that physics can be checked by VACINI.
<p>
Sometimes VACINI is used to read an existing data file and save the
modified data into a new file. If the variable names read from the input file
should be used, write <b>default</b> in the 3rd line.

<H2><A NAME="Actions">Actions</A> and Action-Parameters</h2>

The rest of the parameter file consists of some ACTION defined by a
string followed by several lines containing the ACTIONPARAMETERS.
The type and number of actionparameters are different for each action. 
A parameter file usually contains several ACTION-ACTIONPARAMETERS segments.
In the following I shall describe the existing actions. 

<H4><A NAME="Filetype">Setting</A> the file types: 
     typefileini, typefileout</h4>
<pre>
typefileout
binary
</pre>
   sets the type of the new initial file to binary. The default is 
   <b>ascii</b>. The type of the file read by the <b>read, readnext</b>, or 
   <b>readmesh</b> actions can be set by
<pre>
typefileini
binary
</pre>
   Again, the default type is <b>ascii</b>. The <b>special</b> type can also 
   be used if the <b>readfileini_special</b> and/or <b>savefileout_special</b>
   subroutines are defined in the 
   <A HREF=vacusr.html#Specialio>VACUSR module</A>.

<H4><A NAME="Reading">Reading</A> a file for modification:<br>
read, readnext, readmesh, snapshotini</h4>
<pre>
read
filename
</pre>
   It is possible to read only a part of the file by using 
<pre>
readmesh
filename
2 2 2 2
</pre>
   where the last numbers describe the width of cut off boundaries for the sides
   of a 2D grid. In general the order is left, right, bottom, top, front, back,
   or in other words, xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, zmin, and zmax.
<p>
   If the input file contains more than one snapshots the last one is read
   unless the <b>snapshotini</b> action is applied before reading, e.g.
<pre>
snapshotini
2
read
filename
</pre>
If VACINI is used for transforming several snapshots in a file, 
the <b>readnext</b> action can be used repeatedly after the
first <b>read</b> has been completed. This is usually combined with the
repeated use of the <b>write</b> action. However, using 
<A HREF="convert.html#Convertdata">convertdata</A> may be more convenient.

<H4><A NAME="Grid">Generating</A> a uniform grid: domain, grid</h4>

   An example in 2D is
<pre>
domain
n1,n2
xmin1,xmin2
xmax1,xmax2
</pre>
   This subroutine generates a uniform grid of size <b>n1 x n2</b> in the 
   computational domain <b>[xmin1,xmax1] x [xmin2,xmax2]</b>, i.e. the 
   cell center coordinates will run from xmin+dx/2 to xmax-dx/2.
<p>
   In case the cell center coordinates need to be defined use the <b>grid</b>
   action, e.g. in 1D
<pre>
grid
n1
xmin1
xmax1
</pre>
   will produce a uniform grid with <b>n1</b> cell centers located at 
<b>xmin1,...,xmax1</b>.
<p>

<H4><A NAME="Manipulation">Grid</A> manipulations:<br>
stretchgrid, stretchgridcent, polargrid, spheregrid, rotategrid, shiftgrid, 
sheargrid, roundgrid, regrid, transpose</h4>

   <b>stretchgrid</b> can be used to produce a non-uniform Cartesian grid.
   It should be called after <b>domain</b>, since it leaves the size of the
   computational domain and the number of grid cells intact, only the 
   cell sizes are changed in a piece-wise logarithmic fashion. For example
   the first 20 cells can be clustered closer to the Y axis by
<pre>
stretchgrid
1       2                               -idir, nsegment
5.0                                     -dxlast/dx1 for segment 1
20                                      -ixlast     for segment 1
5.0                                     -dxlast/dx1 for segment 2
</pre>
   The leftmost cell will have 5 times smaller dx size than the cells 
   right of the 20-th column. All sizes are measured against the first cell.
   Another example is a grid with 20 cells along the -L<y<L direction
   with grid points accumulated around y=0 in a symmetric fashion
<pre>
stretchgrid
2       2                               -idir, nsegment
0.1                                     -dxlast/dx1 for segment 1
11                                      -ixlast     for segment 1
1.0                                     -dxlast/dx1 for segment 2
</pre>
   Note that the first segments ends at the 11th grid point, since the
   smallest distance is between the 10th and 11th points, which is 1/10th
   of the distance between the 1st and 2nd or 19th and 20th.
   <b>stretchgrid</b> can be called for each dimension separately.
<p>
   <b>stretchgridcent</b> does the same thing as <b>stretchgrid</b>,
   except that it keeps the position of the first and last grid centers fixed,
   rather than the boundaries of the computational domain. Normally
   <b>stretchgridcent</b> should be used after the <b>grid</b> action.
<p>
   <b>polargrid</b> transforms the <b>x</b> coordinates already defined
   by e.g. the <b>domain</b> action. 
   It assumes that the first coordinate describes radial distance, and the 
   second one is the angle normalized to 1, ie. 1 corresponds 2*pi radians. 
   Thus x1'=x1*cos(2*pi*x2) and x2'=x1*sin(2*pi*x1). For 3D the third 
   coordinate is kept as it is. A cylinder of radius 2, height 4 can be
   defined as
<pre>
domain
20 20 20    - size of grid
 0. 0. 0.   - rmin, phimin, zmin
 2. 1. 4.   - rmax, phimax, zmax
polargrid
</pre>
<p>
   <b>spheregrid</b> transforms the 3 dimensional <b>x</b> coordinates, 
   defined by e.g. the <b>domain</b> action, to a spherical grid. The
   first coordinate is the radial distance <b>r</b>, the second is the 
   azimuthal angle <b>phi</b>, and the last one is the latitude <b>theta</b>
   measured from the equatorial plane. The angles are measured in 2*pi units.
   For example, a spherical shell of inner radius 0.1 and outer radius 10 
   can be de defined as
<pre>
domain
20  40  20      - grid size
0.1  0. -0.25   - rmin, phimin, thetamin
10   1. +0.25   - rmax, phimax, thetamax
spheregrid
</pre>
<p>
   <b>rotategrid</b> rotates <b>x</b>, it is mostly used to test generalized 
   coordinates.
<p>
   <b>shiftgrid</b> and <b>sheargrid</b> shift and shear the grid, 
   see vacini.t.
<p>
   <b>roundgrid</b> shrinks (part of) a rectangular grid to an ellipse 
   relatively smoothly. For example a circular computational domain 
   can be created without a singularity (very elongated cells) at the
   center.
<p>
   <b>regrid</b> can be used to refine or coarsen an existing data read by
   one of the read actions.
<p>
   <b>transpose</b> swaps the <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> axes and the components of
   vector variables.

<H4><A NAME="Variable">Variable</A> manipulations: <br>
setvar, conserve, primitive, multiply, divide, polarvar, spherevar, rotatevar, 
perturbvar</h4>

   <b>setvar</b> can set a number of variables to uniform values in a 
   region defined by index limits. For example to set density and pressure
   in a 2 by 3 region at the bottom left corner
<pre>
setvar
1 1 2 3    - ixmin1,ixmin2,ixmax1,ixmax2
1 0.5 F    - iw=rho_, rho, last=false
4 4.0 T    - iw=p_  , p  , last=true
</pre>
   Initial conditions are often provided in terms of the primitive
   variables. Use the <b>conserve</b> action to transform that to the 
   conservative variables used in the VAC data files.
   For sake of backwards compatibility, the truncated
   name <b>conserv</b> can also be used.
<p>
   The <b>primitive</b> action is the inverse of 'conserve'. It can be
   useful when the conservative variables are read from a file, but the
   modification is easier to do in the primitive variables. Remember to
   convert back to conservative variables before saving the initial condition!
<p>
   The <b>divide</b> and <b>multiply</b> actions allow for conversion
   between different units, they may be applied to the primitive variables
   before <b>conserve</b> is called, or to the conservative variables.
<pre>
polarvar
2 3
</pre>
   will calculate <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> components for the 2nd and 3rd 
   variables from the <b>r</b> and <b>phi</b> polar components defined earlier.
   It assumes <b>x2=2*pi*phi</b>, thus use it <em>before</em> 
   <b>polargrid</b> is called.
<p>
<pre>
cartesian
2 3
</pre>
   does more or less the opposite of <b>polarvar</b>, it converts the
   <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> components of a vector variable to polar components,
   which is useful for <A HREF=axial.html#Polargrid>polar grids</A>.
<p>
   <b>spherevar</b> calculates the <b>x, y, z</b> components of a vector
   variable from the <b>r, phi, theta</b> components defined earlier.
   The coordinates are interpreted as <b>x1=r, x2=2*pi*phi, x3=2*pi*theta</b>,
   thus <b>spherevar</b> should be used <em>before</em> the <b>spheregrid</b> 
   action.
<p>
   <b>rotatevar</b> rotates 2 components of a vector variable (e.g. velocity) 
   by some angle. <b>perturbvar</b> adds the product of sine waves in each 
   direction to the original value of a specific variable within a rectangle.

<H4><A NAME="General">General</A> initialization subroutines:<br>
uniform, shocktube, wave</h4>

   The <b>uniform</b> subroutine sets each variable to a spatially uniform 
   value in the whole domain. E.g. in 3D MHD
<pre>
uniform
1. 0. 0. 0. 10. 0.12 -0.2 0.3   - rho m1 m2 m3 e b1 b2 b3
</pre>
   The <b>shocktube</b> subroutine generates linearly interpolated 
   segments for each variable along one of the axes of the grid. 
   For example the 'Sod' shocktube problem in 1.5D hydrodynamics
   on a grid of 100 cells can be setup as
<pre>
shocktube
1                               -shock direction
3                               -number of segments
1.0   0 2.5                     -state of left boundary
1.0   0 2.5                     -state of end of segment 1
49                              -position of segment-end 1
0.125 0 0.25                    -state of end of segment 2
52                              -position of segment-end 2
0.125 0 0.25                    -state of end of segment 3
1.4                             -gamma
</pre>
   Note that the jump itself is a segment, which is smeared out to 4 cells
in this example.
<p> 
   The <b>wave</b> action can add waves of given amplitude and phase for each 
   variable and direction separately. The variables fluctuate around some mean
   values. For example the Orszag-Tang vortex problem can be defined as
<pre>
wave
2.778   0.      0.      1.667   0.      0.      -mean values
0.      0.      0.      0       0       0       T -rho (ampl,k,phase idim=1,2)
0.      0.      0.      -1.     1.      0.      T -v1
1.      1.      0.      0.      0.      0.      T -v2
0.      0.      0.      0.      0.      0.      T -p
0.      0.      0.      -1.     1.      0.      T -b1
1.      2.      0.      0.      0.      0.      T -b2
1.667   0.                                      -gamma, eta
</pre>
   in terms of primitive variables, so a <b>conserve</b> action is needed
   before saving the initial data.
<p>
   The shocktube and wave subroutines ask for the <b>eqpar</b> array
   at the end which is an obsolete feature from the time when the 
   <b>eqpar</b> action has not been defined yet. 

<H4><A NAME="Special">Special</A> initialization subroutine: special</h4>

   <b>special</b> results in a call of the <b>specialini</b> subroutine defined
   in the <A HREF="vacusr.html#Specialini">VACUSR module</A>. This subroutine 
   normally defines <b>w</b>, it may also determine the <b>x</b> 
   coordinates, the <b>ixM^L</b> limits or any other common variables 
   declared in <b>src/vacdef.t</b>. You may provide parameters for the
   <b>special</b> action the same way as for other actions:
<pre>
special
param1,param2
param3
</pre>
   These parameters may be read by the <b>specialini</b> subroutine
   with simple read statements, like 

<pre>
read(*,*)param1,param2
read(*,'(a)')param3
</pre>

<H4><A NAME="Parameters">Setting</A> parameters: eqpar, gencoord</h4>

   The <b>eqpar</b> action can be used to set all the equation parameters.
   This array contains the <b>neqpar</b> equation parameters 
   e.g. the adiabatic index eqpar(gamma_), where <b>gamma_</b> is an integer 
   index defined in the equation-specific <b>src/vacpar.t</b> source file. 
   The equation parameters also contain <b>nspecialpar</b> problem dependent 
   parameters, their index names are defined in the <b>src/vacusrpar.t</b> 
   file. This approach provides means for an arbitrary number of double 
   precision equation parameters which are stored in the header of the data
   files. 
<p>
   The <b>gencoord</b> action can be used to change the logical variable 
   if the default value <b>F</b> (false, i.e. rectangular grid), or the value 
   <b>T</b> (true, i.e. generalized coordinates, set by, e.g., the 
   <b>polargrid</b>, <b>roundgrid</b> or <b>rotategrid</b> actions) should 
   be overruled.

<H4><A NAME="Saving">Saving</A> the initial file: save, write</h4>

   All parameter files for VACINI should end with the 
<pre>
save
</pre> 
   action, which saves the initial conditions into the new initial file and 
   stops VACINI. The filetype is <b>ascii</b> by default, but this can be 
   changed by the <b>typefileout</b> action. The <b>write</b> action
   appends the current snapshot to the end of the output file without 
   exiting VACINI. This is useful for transforming more than one snapshots
   by means of VACINI, see also <b>readnext</b>, and also the 
   <A HREF="convert.html#Convertdata">convertdata</A> program.

<H2><A NAME="Example">Example</A>: inipar/brio12</h2>

   the following file creates the standard initial conditions for the
   Brio-Wu MHD shock tube problem.
   Note that comments following the numbers are disregarded by Fortran,
   however strings have to stand alone in their line.
<pre>
