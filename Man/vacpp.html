<h1>VAC PREPROCESSOR</h1>

This document briefly describes the use of the VAC PreProcessor (VACPP)
which converts dimension independent notation into Fortran 90.
VACPP is a specialized implementation of the general 
<A HREF="http://hermes.elte.hu/~gtoth/Papers/vac.html#LASY"
>LASY Preprocessor</A>.
<hr>
   VACPP is implemented in Perl in the <b>src/vacpp.pl</b> script. 
   The main variables of VACPP, such as the number of dimensions 
   <b>$ndim</b> and vector components <b>$ndir</b>, 
   or the values of the logical variables corresponding to various modules
   ($if_tvd, $if_fct etc.) are normally modified by another Perl script 
   <b>src/setvac</b>. Based on these variables and the LASY patterns
   in the <b>*.t</b> source files VACPP generates the Fortran 90 source code 
   of the output <b>*.f</b> files.
<p>
   The Perl script <b>src/forall2do</b> can be used as an additional 
   translator to replace the FORALL statements by ordinary DO loops, which is
   required only, if the code will be compiled by a Fortran 90 compiler that 
   does not recognize the FORALL statement. When any of the Perl scripts 
   <b>src/f90tof77</b> or <b>src/f90tohpf</b> are used for 
   further translation, there is no need for <b>src/forall2do</b>. 
<p>
   The maximum length of the lines is determined by the <i>final</i> 
   translation step and it can be set by the <b>-maxlen=...</b> flag for 
   any of the above mentioned Perl scripts. By default the output lines are 
   at most 80 character long. Most F90, F77, or HPF compilers have flags 
   to accept such line length, but if this is not the case, you may 
   set '-maxlen=72' for the last preprocessor in <b>src/Makefile</b>.
<p>
   The <b>-O</b> flag is used on parallel machines to improve communication
   speed. With this optimization flag, the general index shifts marked by 
   the special !SHIFT comments in the source code <b>*.t</b> are 
   translated to a combination of IF statements and simpler shifts.
   This optimization improves performance for parallel machines significantly,
   thus <b>make vachpf</b> uses this optimization by default and 
   it is advised to select the definition 
   <b>VACPP=vacpp.pl -O</b> in the <b>src/Makefile</b> for parallel machines.
<p>
   The preprocessor is mainly used via the Makefile, but one can translate
   a single file directly, or even use the preprocessor interactively, when
   the dimension independent notation is typed in line by line from the 
   keyboard and the expanded code appears on the screen. The interactive 
   use is a very efficient way of checking the syntax of complex dimension 
   independent notation. For interactive usage the
   number of dimensions and vector components can be overdefined temporarily 
   with the <b>-d</b> flag. For example type (<em>note the last dash!</em>)
<pre>
vacpp.pl -d=23 -
^D
1,2
^C
1,2,3
x(ixI^S,1)
x(ixImin1:ixImax1,ixImin2:ixImax2,1)
...
Ctrl-D
</pre>
   You may use <b>vacpp.pl</b> for translation directly
<pre>
vacpp.pl FILENAME.t &gt; FILENAME.f
</pre>
   or indirectly via the Makefile with
<pre>
make FILENAME.f
</pre>
   You may switch on shift optimization and/or change the maximum line 
   length to e.g. 72 directly on the command line
<pre>
vacpp.pl -O FILENAME.t &gt; FILENAME.f
vacpp.pl -maxlen=72 FILENAME.t &gt; FILENAME.f
</pre>
   or edit the <b>src/Makefile</b> accordingly.
