<H2><A NAME="Equation">Equation</A></H2>

VAC aims to solve a system of partial differential equations of the form  
<pre>
dw/dt=dF_i(w)/dx_i+S(w)=R(w)
</pre>
where w is a vector of <b>iw=1..nw</b> flow variables, <b>F_i</b> are fluxes in
<b>idim=1..ndim</b> directions for each <b>w</b>, and <b>S</b> is the 
source including all terms which are not described by <b>F_i</b>. 
The flux and source terms together are denoted by <b>R</b>.
The name of the equation is declared as a character string parameter 
<b>typephys</b> in <b>src/vacpar.t.EQUATION</b>.

<H2><A NAME="Splitting">Dimensional</A> and Source Splitting</H2>

Some methods were originally designed to handle 1D problems, they may be
best applied to multidimensional problems by splitting the equation for
the derivatives of the flux, and solving the split equations in subsequent 
sweeps. For a forward Euler time integration scheme the above equation can be 
discretised in time as
<pre>
 n+1                        n
w    = [I+dt*(Fx+Fy+Fz+S)] w
</pre>
where Fx, Fy, and Fz are short notations for the dF_i/dx_i terms for 3D.
<p>
Dimensional splitting means the following approximations:
<pre>
I+dt*(Fx+Fy+S)    --> [I+dt*(Fx+S/2)] [I+dt*(Fy+S/2)]                   (2D)

I+dt*(Fx+Fy+Fz+S) --> [I+dt*(Fx+S/3)] [I+dt*(Fy+S/3)] [I+dt*(Fz+S/3)]   (3D)
</pre>
<p>
To achieve 2-nd order time accuracy, the individual operators have to be 
second order accurate, <em>and</em> the order of the sweeps needs to be
alternated in every second time step, <b>typedimsplit='xyyx'</b>. 
This alternation can be switched off by <b>typedimsplit='xy'</b> which may be 
useful for steady state calculations, where the time accuracy is not an issue, 
on the other hand
the alternation makes the even and odd time steps numerically different, 
which leads to finite amplitude oscillations. For steady state calculations,
however, no dimensional splitting at all, <b>dimsplit=F</b>,
may be an even better choice.
<p>
The source terms S may also be separated from the fluxes F.
A reason to use split source terms may arise,
when the sources are stiff, or unstable for an explicit evaluation.
In that case, a split <em>pointwise</em> implicit evaluation may be a solution.
Setting <b>typesourcesplit='sfs'</b> results in
<pre>
I+dt*(Fx+Fy+Fz+S) --> [I+dt/2*S] [I+dt*(Fx+Fy+Fz)] [I+dt/2*S]
</pre>
for the dimensionally unsplit case, and
<pre>
I+dt*(Fx+Fy+S)    --> [I+dt/2*S] [I+dt*Fx] [I+dt*Fy] [I+dt/2*S]            (2D)

I+dt*(Fx+Fy+Fz+S) --> [I+dt/2*S] [I+dt*Fx] [I+dt*Fy] [I+dt*Fz] [I+dt/2*S]  (3D)
</pre>
for the dimensionally split case. To achieve second order time accuracy,
the numerical representation of the source term <b>S</b> should be second 
order accurate in time. In case of special source terms written by the user, 
this may be achieved by implementing e.g. a trapezoidal scheme in the 
<b>specialsource</b> subroutine. 
<p>
However a simple second order Runge-Kutta evaluation is already built in. 
Setting <b>typesourcesplit='ssfss'</b> gives the following evaluation for 
<b>w_S = [I+dt/2*S] w</b>:
<pre>
w_1 = w + dt/4 S(w)
w_S = w + dt/2 S(w_1)
</pre>
both at the beginning and at the end of the time step, otherwise the
default <b>w_S = w + dt/2 S(w)</b> is used. Other choices for 
<b>typesourcesplit</b> are <b>'sf', 'ssf'</b>, and of course the default
<b>sourcesplit=F</b>.

<H2><A NAME="Methods">Time</A> Discretization</H2>

The code can use a variety of <A HREF="methods.html">methods</A> for spatial 
discretization of fluxes. A method may be applied to only a subset of the 
<b>nw</b> variables when some of the variables are not advanced
(formally the <b>'nul'</b> method is applied to those).
The indices of the subset are typically in a local array <b>iws</b>. 
The number of <b>iw</b> indices is in the element <b>iws(niw_)</b>, 
thus the indices are usually calculated with a loop like
<pre>
do iiw=1,iws(niw_); iw=iws(iiw)
</pre>
As we saw in the previous section, the contribution of the fluxes 
(dimensionally split or unsplit, with or without the source terms) 
need to be evaluated to at least 2nd order accuracy in time.
Let <b>R</b> denote the general operator that represents any of the
Fx, (Fz+S/3), (Fx+Fy), (Fx+Fy+Fz+S), etc. terms that arise in the 
equations above depending on the number of dimensions and on the dimensional 
and source splitting parameters.
<p>
There are many options to evaluate <b>w_R=[I+dt*R] w</b>,
it is determined by the value of the <b>typeadvance</b> parameter
with the following options:
<pre>
w_R = w + dt*R(w)                     'onestep'

w_1 = w + dt/2*R'(w)                  'twostep'  (predictor step)
w_R = w + dt  *R (w_1)                           (corrector step)

w_1 = w          + dt  *R(w)          'threestep'
w_2 =(3*w+w_1)/4 + dt/4*R(w_1)
w_R =(w+2*w_2)/3 + dt/2*R(w_2)

w_1 = w + dt/2*R(w)	              'fourstep' (classical RK4)
w_2 = w + dt/2*R(w_1)
w_3 = w + dt  *R(w_2)
w_4 = w + dt/6*R(w_3)
w   = w + dt/6*[R(w_1)+2*R(w_2)+2*R(w_3)+R(w_4)]

w_1 = w + dt*0.12*R(w)                'sterck'
w_2 = w + dt*0.25*R(w_1)
w_3 = w + dt*0.5 *R(w_2)
w_R = w + dt     *R(w_3)

w_1 = w + dt/4*R(w)                   'jameson'
w_2 = w + dt/3*R(w_1)
w_3 = w + dt/2*R(w_2)
w_R = w + dt  *R(w_3)
</pre>
The three-step method is 3rd order accurate, RK4 is fourth order accurate, 
while the last two methods are 2nd order accurate only for nonlinear problems.
The multistep methods may allow Courant numbers <b>C&gt;1</b>, 
but this is not a good idea for the schemes using
Riemann solvers, since they assume explicitly <b>C&lt;1</b>.
<p>
By default, TVD and the MacCormack scheme use <b>typeadvance='onestep'</b>, 
while the other temporally second order methods TVDLF, TVD-MUSCL, and FCT 
use <b>typeadvance='twostep'</b>.
Since in the twostep method the <b>R'</b> spatial discretization in the 
first <em>predictor</em> step can be different from <b>R</b> of the second
<em>corrector</em> step, the twostep time integration is a predictor-corrector 
type scheme. In the parameter file, the arrays <b>typepred</b> and 
<b>typefull</b> determine methods applied in the predictor and full steps.
Internally the arrays <b>iw_pred</b> and <b>iw_full</b> list the variable 
indices to be advanced by the predictor and full steps, and <b>typepred1</b> 
and <b>typefull1</b> contain the name of the numerical schemes for them.
<p>
For the other multistep integration schemes the same <b>typefull1</b> 
method is used in each substep for <b>istep=1..nstep</b>.
Full timesteps are counted by <b>itmin &lt;= it &lt;= itmax</b>, while the
physical time is <b>t &lt;= tmax</b>.
<p>
The implicit time integration schemes are described in detail in a paper
<A HREF="http://hermes.elte.hu/~gtoth/Papers/vac.html#ImplvacA">
Implicit and semi-implicit schemes: algorithms</A>.
In essence, the <b>iw_impl</b> array determines which variables are treated
implicitly, and <b>typeimpl1</b> defines the method for evaluating the Jacobian
<b>dR/dw</b>.

<H2><A NAME="Grid">Grid</A> and Mesh</H2>

The grid is a 1, 2 or 3D structured grid, either Cartesian, polar, or it is
defined with generalized coordinates. The coordinates of the grid points are 
represented by the array <b>x</b>, usually interpreted as Cartesian
coordinates X, Y, and Z, except for polar grid, when they contain R, PHI,
and Z instead.
Other useful cell-related quantities calculated from <b>x</b>, like distance
between cell interfaces, volume, surface, and surface normal, are stored in 
the common arrays <b>dx, dvolume, surfaceC</b>, and <b>normalC</b>, 
respectively. These common arrays are all declared in <b>src/vacdef.t</b>.
The <b>gencoord</b> global logical variable is true for generalized
coordinates and false for the simple Cartesian or polar mesh. In the data files
a <b>negative sign</b> before the value of NDIM is used to indicate generalized
coordinates.
<p>
The spatial indices of these arrays, denoted by the dimension independent
<A HREF="source.html">syntax</A>, have a maximum possible range of
<pre>
ixGlo^D:ixGhi^D = ixG^T
</pre>
The actual range, including ghost cells describing the boundaries, is
<pre>
ixGmin^D:ixGmax^D = ixG^S
</pre>
<b>The mesh is defined as the grid without boundary layers</b>:
<pre>
ixMmin^D,ixMmax^D = ixGmin^D+dixBmin^D,ixGmax^D-dixBmax^D
</pre>
or in a shorter notation
<pre>
ixM^L = ixG^L^LSUBdixB^L
</pre>
The boundaries extend the min and max sides by their widths:
<pre>
dixBmin^D, dixBmax^D = dixB^L
</pre>
Note that for VACINI there are no ghost cells as it does not in general need 
derivatives, thus dixB^L=0, and the mesh and the grid coincide.
For VAC, however, the physical mesh is surrounded by layers of ghost cells
which are updated by the boundary subroutine <b>getboundary</b>. When a file
is read or saved by VAC the ghost cells are included or not according to the 
values of the <b>fullgridini</b> and <b>fullgridout</b> logical variables 
set in the <A HREF="par.html#Filelist">parameter file</A>. For VACINI you 
can simply define the grid to be bigger or smaller.
<p>
You may run the <A HREF="vacpp.html">VACPP</A> preprocessor interactively 
to see how the above expressions are translated for a given number of 
dimensions.

<H2><A NAME="Boundary">Boundary</A> Regions</H2>

The boundary cells of the grid are grouped into boundary regions indexed by
<b>iB=1..nB</b>. They are orthogonal to the direction <b>idimB(iB)</b> 
and the side is determined by <b>upperB(iB)</b>. 
By default the boundary regions cover the <b>2*ndim</b> edges of the grid 
in the <em>left, right, bottom, top, front, back</em>, in other words, 
<em>ixmin1, ixmax1, ixmin2, ixmax2, ixmin3, ixmax3</em>, order. 
The regions overlap at the corner ghost cells but that should not matter.
The location of the boundary regions can be changed in the 
<A HREF=par.html#Boundlist>&amp;boundlist</A> of the parameter file 
by explicitly defining all the boundary parameters.
The location of a boundary region is defined by:
<pre>
ixBmin(idim,iB)..ixBmax(idim,iB) = ixB^LIM(idim,iB)
</pre>
The boundary methods are applied to each boundary region from <b>iB=1</b> 
to <b>nB</b> and for each variable from <b>iw=1</b> to <b>nw</b> according 
to the descriptor string <b>typeB(iw,iB)</b>. An exception is made for 
the <b>special</b> type variables, they are called <em>after</em> the other
variables have been extrapolated into the boundary region. 
This does not fully work for FCT where the boundary subroutine is called 
for the diffused variables individually in the order of their indices,
but the error produced by this inconsistency is probably rather small.
<p>
Please note that the boundary itself is at the interface between the real and
ghost cells, therefore setting the velocity to 0 in the ghost cell will not
make the velocity 0 at the cell interface which is an interpolated value.
To have exactly zero flux through the boundary, the <b>'symm0'</b> boundary 
type should be used for the scalar quantities and the tangential velocity
components. For the normal vector components the  anti-symmetric <b>asymm</b>
boundary type should be used.
