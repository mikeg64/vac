@(#)README	2.1
This directory contains the include files used by lover.

'lover.h' is an include file intended to be used by the user. It contains 
symbolic parameters to indicate primitive types (float, double),
structure types (scalar, 3-vector), field formats (internal or 
general, ascii or binary), etc. The parameters can be passed as 
arguments to the lover subroutines (see the documentation).

'comorde' is the include file which determines the binary byte 
order which defaults to msb. If you have a machine with lsb 
ordering you will have to change this file.
