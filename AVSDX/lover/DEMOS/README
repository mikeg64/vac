@(#)README	2.1
This directory contains demos for the LOVER package.
The demos are compiled automatically with the installation
script. They can be compiled using the Makefile in this
directory by providing the macros on the command line:

        F77, F77FLAGS, LOVER, LIB, INCLUDE.

F77 contains the name of the FORTRAN compiler, e.g. f77

F77FLAGS contains the flags to be passed to the compiler, e.g. -O
Remember that on workstations the autodbl flag has to be passed to 
the compiler as LOVER itself is compiled with this flag.

LOVER contains top directory name of the LOVER tree.

LIB specifies where the library archive liblover.a has been placed.

INCLUDE specifies where the lover include file lover.h has been placed.

If you do not specify these last three macros they will default to:

        LOVER   /usr/local
        LIB     /usr/local/lib
        INCLUDE /usr/local/include

For example, on IBM RS6000 machines one could type:

        make F77=xlf F77FLAGS="-qautodbl=dbl4" LOVER=$HOME/usr/local/lover
