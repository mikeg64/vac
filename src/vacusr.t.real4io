! This VACUSR module is provided for convenience to allow the use of REAL*4 
! binary data files by simply using
!
! setvac -u=real4io
!
! and setting "typefileini" or "typefileout" to 'special'.
!
! If you need a VACUSR module for other reasons too, INCLUDE:vacusr.real4io.t
! directly into that file.
